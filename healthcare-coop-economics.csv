NOTE: The negative net margins indicate this model needs higher member fees OR lower costs to be sustainable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Recommended adjustments:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- Increase member fees to $175-200/month OR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- Add grant funding or subsidies OR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- Leverage volunteer support OR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- Implement tiered pricing (higher income members pay more),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
