PART 10: SUMMARY & RECOMMENDATIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Key Findings:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. At $450/member/month the model is financially sustainable at scale (>750 members),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. Break-even occurs around 750-900 members depending on growth rate and churn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. Employer saves $10000-$15000 per employee per year vs traditional insurance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. Initial capital requirement: $1M (covers startup + 18-24 months operating losses),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. Mental health staffing is critical - represents 20-30% of total staff FTEs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6. Reinsurance costs ~10% of member fees ($54/member/month) for catastrophic coverage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7. At 1000 members annual surplus of $557k available for reserves and service expansion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8. Low churn (2-2.5%) through employer groups is essential to model sustainability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Critical Success Factors:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- Secure 1-2 anchor employers (200-400 employees total) before launch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- Maintain low administrative overhead (Federation model allows shared services),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- Invest heavily in care coordination (prevents expensive downstream costs),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- Negotiate strong reinsurance rates (critical to margins),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- Focus on preventive care utilization (reduces long-term costs),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- Maintain clinical quality to minimize member churn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Recommended Pilot Path:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Launch with 100-200 members validate operations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phase 2 (Months 7-12): Grow to 400-600 members optimize staffing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phase 3 (Months 13-24): Reach 800-1000 members approach break-even,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phase 4 (Months 25-36): Scale to 1200-1500 members build reserves for expansion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
