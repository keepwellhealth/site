<h1 id="keepwell-health-union">Keepwell Health Union</h1>
<p><em>A nonprofit healthcare cooperative</em></p>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Keepwell Health Union is a nonprofit, clinician-led healthcare
cooperative designed to provide high-quality, humane, and
cost-predictable care by removing insurance from routine medical
decision-making and confining it to catastrophic risk where it
belongs.</p>
<p>Keepwell delivers primary care, mental health, urgent care,
diagnostics, and care coordination directly to members through
employer-based enrollment. Rare, high-cost events such as major surgery,
trauma, or complex hospitalization are protected through external
reinsurance (stop-loss coverage), ensuring financial stability without
reverting to traditional insurance models.</p>
<p>The result is a healthcare system that is simpler, more transparent,
more humane, and economically sustainable—without denying care or
shifting risk onto patients.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>The U.S. healthcare system is not failing because of bad medicine. It
is failing because of distorted incentives.</p>
<p>Key dysfunctions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insurance intermediaries sit inside routine care decisions</li>
<li>Providers spend enormous time on billing, coding, and
authorization</li>
<li>Employers face unpredictable cost increases with no leverage</li>
<li>Patients experience delays, denials, fragmentation, and
confusion</li>
<li>Clinicians burn out under administrative load rather than medical
complexity</li>
</ul>
<p>Most healthcare spending is predictable and preventable. The system
treats it as adversarial and opaque.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="core-idea">Core Idea</h2>
<p><strong>Separate healthcare delivery from catastrophic risk
management.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Routine and preventive care should be delivered directly by
clinicians</li>
<li>Rare, high-cost events should be insured at the system level</li>
<li>Members should belong to the system, not shop for it</li>
<li>Governance should prevent profit extraction from care decisions</li>
</ul>
<p>Keepwell Health Union implements this separation structurally.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="organizational-structure">Organizational Structure</h2>
<p><strong>Legal form:</strong> Nonprofit healthcare cooperative</p>
<p><strong>Governance principles:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No shareholders</li>
<li>Explicit prohibition on for-profit conversion</li>
<li>Clinician representation in governance</li>
<li>Member-first fiduciary responsibility</li>
<li>Financial transparency</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Membership model:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Enrollment through employers (primary channel)</li>
<li>Employers fund care on a per-member basis</li>
<li>Members receive care, not insurance policies</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="scope-of-care-initial-launch">Scope of Care (Initial
Launch)</h2>
<p><strong>Included services</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Primary care</li>
<li>Mental health (therapy + psychiatric care)</li>
<li>Urgent care</li>
<li>Labs and basic imaging (partnered)</li>
<li>Care coordination and referrals</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Excluded initially</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Inpatient hospitalization</li>
<li>Major surgery</li>
<li>Oncology, NICU, trauma care</li>
</ul>
<p>These are handled through negotiated provider relationships and
reinsurance protection.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="reinsurance-catastrophic-coverage">Reinsurance (Catastrophic
Coverage)</h2>
<p>Keepwell does not sell insurance to members. Instead, it carries
<strong>external reinsurance</strong> to protect the cooperative against
rare, extreme costs.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-coverage">Types of coverage</h3>
<p><strong>Specific stop-loss</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Protects against high-cost individuals</li>
<li>Example: Keepwell covers first $250,000 per member per year</li>
<li>Reinsurer covers costs above that threshold</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aggregate stop-loss</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Protects against population-wide cost overruns</li>
<li>Example: Expected annual spend $15M, attachment at $18M</li>
<li>Reinsurer covers costs above attachment point</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-this-works">Why this works</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reinsurance engages only for rare events</li>
<li>No claims handling for routine care</li>
<li>No interference in clinical decision-making</li>
<li>Predictable costs for employers and members</li>
</ul>
<p>Insurance is confined to what it does best: tail risk.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="why-this-will-work">Why This Will Work</h2>
<h3 id="employer-based-enrollment-solves-adverse-selection">1.
Employer-based enrollment solves adverse selection</h3>
<p>Whole workforces enroll together, creating stable, predictable risk
pools. This model is already accepted and understood by regulators and
employers.</p>
<h3 id="most-healthcare-utilization-is-routine">2. Most healthcare
utilization is routine</h3>
<p>Primary care, mental health, and urgent care account for the majority
of interactions. Removing insurance friction here produces immediate
cost and access improvements.</p>
<h3 id="clinician-incentives-are-restored">3. Clinician incentives are
restored</h3>
<ul>
<li>No prior authorizations</li>
<li>No billing games</li>
<li>Reasonable patient panels</li>
<li>Time to practice medicine</li>
</ul>
<p>This directly improves outcomes and retention.</p>
<h3 id="reinsurance-removes-existential-risk">4. Reinsurance removes
existential risk</h3>
<p>Keepwell never carries unlimited downside. Catastrophic events do not
threaten solvency or force care rationing.</p>
<h3 id="surplus-becomes-resilience-not-extraction">5. Surplus becomes
resilience, not extraction</h3>
<p>Any operational surplus is reinvested into:</p>
<ul>
<li>lower employer costs</li>
<li>clinician pay and staffing</li>
<li>expanded access</li>
<li>improved facilities</li>
<li>financial reserves</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h2 id="revenue-model-illustrative">Revenue Model (Illustrative)</h2>
<p>Employer contribution example:</p>
<ul>
<li>$450 per member per month</li>
</ul>
<p>3,000 members × $450 × 12 = <strong>~$16.2M annualized</strong></p>
<p>This supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>full operations</li>
<li>reinsurance premiums</li>
<li>reserves</li>
<li>reinvestment</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="role-of-philanthropy">Role of Philanthropy</h2>
<p>Philanthropy is used as <strong>infrastructure capital</strong>, not
operating subsidy.</p>
<p>Funds support:</p>
<ul>
<li>clinic buildout</li>
<li>early operational runway</li>
<li>technology</li>
<li>negotiation leverage</li>

<li>Second clinic planned</li>
<li>Reinsurance fully optimized</li>
<li>Employer renewal rates &gt; 90%</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Keepwell Health Union is not an attempt to “disrupt healthcare.” It
is an attempt to <strong>remove unnecessary harm</strong> from a system
that has forgotten its purpose.</p>
<p>By restoring clear incentives, constraining insurance to its proper
role, and designing governance that resists extraction, Keepwell offers
a durable, humane alternative that can scale metro by metro.</p>
