**KeepWell Health Union — Community-Backed Healthcare Infrastructure**

---

## Executive Summary

KeepWell Health Union is a nonprofit healthcare cooperative launching a downtown San Francisco primary care clinic serving employer-sponsored members at a fixed $500 PMPM. The model replaces traditional insurance-driven primary care with direct care delivery, capped membership, and catastrophic coverage via reinsurance.

The objective is stable, high-quality care at lower total employer cost, while generating predictable cash flow suitable for capped-return, mission-aligned capital.

## The Problem

Employers face:

* Rising healthcare premiums ($700–$1,000 PMPM)
* Poor access and long wait times
* No visibility into outcomes or utilization
* Zero control over annual cost increases

Primary care has been hollowed out, driving expensive downstream events.

---

## The Solution

KeepWell directly employs clinicians, limits patient panels, and focuses on early intervention and continuity of care.

Key features:

* $500 PMPM, flat and transparent
* 1,500–3,000 member cap per clinic
* Reinsurance covers catastrophic events
* Surplus reinvested into care, reserves, and expansion

---
