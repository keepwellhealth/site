<h1 id="the-mother-keepwell-charter">The Mother Keepwell Charter</h1>
<h2 id="a-constitution-for-a-federated-health-union">A Constitution for
a Federated Health Union</h2>
<hr />
<h2 id="preface-why-this-document-exists">Preface: Why This Document
Exists</h2>
<p>This document serves two purposes at once.</p>
<p>First, it is a book: a clear articulation of the beliefs, ethics, and
structural insights behind Keepwell Health Union. It explains
<em>why</em> the current healthcare system behaves the way it does,
<em>why</em> reform efforts so often fail, and <em>why</em> a different
governance model is not only possible but necessary.</p>
<p>Second, it is a constitution: a binding charter that defines how
Keepwell Health Union operates, governs itself, and replicates without
losing its moral center. It is intended to be read by members,
clinicians, employers, regulators, and future stewards of the
system.</p>
<p>This document is written in plain language by design. Healthcare
fails when its rules are too complex to be understood by the people they
affect.</p>

<h2 id="part-vi-financial-stewardship">Part VI — Financial
Stewardship</h2>
<h3 id="surplus-is-not-profit">16. Surplus Is Not Profit</h3>
<p>Surplus within Keepwell Health Union is not profit in the commercial
sense. It represents temporary excess of contributions over expenditures
and is understood to belong to the members collectively. Surplus exists
to stabilize care delivery, reduce future costs, and strengthen
resilience against uncertainty.</p>
<p>No surplus may be distributed to private individuals, converted into
equity, or used to incentivize extraction. All surplus must remain
within the system and serve the mission.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="reserves-stability-and-fee-reduction">17. Reserves, Stability,
and Fee Reduction</h3>
<p>Keepwell Health Union shall maintain operating and risk reserves
sufficient to ensure continuity of care under adverse conditions.
Reserves exist to smooth volatility, not to speculate or accumulate
prestige.</p>
<p>Reserves may be held in conservative, low-risk instruments designed
to preserve principal and liquidity. Interest or earnings generated by
reserves shall be treated as program income and applied toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stabilizing or reducing member fees</li>
<li>Expanding access to care</li>
<li>Strengthening staffing capacity</li>
<li>Reinforcing long-term resilience</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="reserve-to-risk-ratio-policy">18. Reserve-to-Risk Ratio
Policy</h3>
<p>Keepwell Health Union shall maintain a formal Reserve-to-Risk Ratio
(RRR) policy governing the relationship between retained reserves and
assumed financial risk.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Defined Risk Exposure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Risk exposure shall be calculated annually based on historical
utilization, membership size, demographic mix, and actuarial
projections.</li>
<li>Only risks that are predictable, bounded, and absorbable may be
considered for internal assumption.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Minimum Reserve Thresholds</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>For any category of internally assumed risk, reserves must equal
or exceed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>125%</strong> of projected annual exposure for routine and
predictable costs</li>
<li><strong>150%–200%</strong> for episodic or moderately volatile
costs</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Catastrophic and unbounded risks shall always require external
coverage regardless of reserve size.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Liquidity Requirement</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A minimum of <strong>50% of required reserves</strong> must be held
in liquid or near-liquid form to ensure rapid response.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Automatic Adjustment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If reserves fall below required thresholds, Keepwell shall
automatically reduce assumed risk and increase external coverage without
requiring discretionary approval.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="governance-of-reinsurance-and-risk-assumption">19. Governance of
Reinsurance and Risk Assumption</h3>
<p>Keepwell Health Union recognizes reinsurance as a protective
instrument, not a failure of autonomy.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Initial Posture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New or expanding unions shall begin with conservative reinsurance
coverage protecting against all major inpatient and catastrophic
events.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Graduated Risk Retention</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Over time, Keepwell may assume responsibility for broader categories
of cost only when supported by sufficient reserves, stable outcomes, and
actuarial validation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Prohibited Actions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Risk may not be expanded to improve short-term financial
appearance</li>
<li>Risk may not be assumed to avoid reinsurance premiums absent
adequate reserves</li>
<li>Risk may not be assumed if doing so threatens continuity of
care</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Independent Review</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All changes to risk retention thresholds shall be reviewed by an
independent committee including clinical, financial, and member
representation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="the-noego-rulebook-for-risk-assumption">20. The No‑Ego Rulebook
for Risk Assumption</h3>
<p>Risk assumption within Keepwell Health Union is governed by humility,
not ambition.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Continuity First</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The primary test of any risk decision is whether care can continue
uninterrupted under worst‑case conditions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Reversibility Is Required</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All expansions of internal risk must be reversible without
destabilizing operations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Outcomes Over Optics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Decisions may not be justified by independence, prestige, or
narrative appeal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Bad Years Are Signals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adverse outcomes trigger automatic retreat to safer risk postures
and reinvestment in system repair.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>No Heroics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No individual or board may authorize risk levels that depend on
exceptional performance or luck.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Mother Keepwell Test</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If a reasonable steward, acting solely for the long-term wellbeing
of members, would decline the risk, it shall not be assumed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Risk is not conquered. It is respected.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="closing-the-work-of-keeping-well">Closing: The Work of Keeping
Well</h2>
<p>Health systems rarely fail because people stop caring. They fail
because the structures make care impossible to sustain.</p>
<p>This Charter exists to ensure that caring remains the easiest
path—not the hardest.</p>
<p>In all decisions, this institution is guided by a simple
expectation:</p>
<p>If Mother Keepwell were watching, would we say we kept faith?</p>
