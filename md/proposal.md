# Keepwell Health Union

*A nonprofit healthcare cooperative*

## Executive Summary

Keepwell Health Union is a nonprofit, clinician-led healthcare cooperative designed to provide high-quality, humane, and cost-predictable care by removing insurance from routine medical decision-making and confining it to catastrophic risk where it belongs.

Keepwell delivers primary care, mental health, urgent care, diagnostics, and care coordination directly to members through employer-based enrollment. Rare, high-cost events such as major surgery, trauma, or complex hospitalization are protected through external reinsurance (stop-loss coverage), ensuring financial stability without reverting to traditional insurance models.

The result is a healthcare system that is simpler, more transparent, more humane, and economically sustainable—without denying care or shifting risk onto patients.

## The Problem

The U.S. healthcare system is not failing because of bad medicine. It is failing because of distorted incentives.

Key dysfunctions:

* Insurance intermediaries sit inside routine care decisions
* Providers spend enormous time on billing, coding, and authorization
* Employers face unpredictable cost increases with no leverage
* Patients experience delays, denials, fragmentation, and confusion
* Clinicians burn out under administrative load rather than medical complexity

Most healthcare spending is predictable and preventable. The system treats it as adversarial and opaque.

---

## Core Idea

**Separate healthcare delivery from catastrophic risk management.**

* Routine and preventive care should be delivered directly by clinicians
* Rare, high-cost events should be insured at the system level
* Members should belong to the system, not shop for it
* Governance should prevent profit extraction from care decisions

Keepwell Health Union implements this separation structurally.

## Organizational Structure

**Legal form:**
Nonprofit healthcare cooperative

**Governance principles:**

* No shareholders
* Explicit prohibition on for-profit conversion
* Clinician representation in governance
* Member-first fiduciary responsibility
* Financial transparency

**Membership model:**

* Enrollment through employers (primary channel)
* Employers fund care on a per-member basis
* Members receive care, not insurance policies

---

## Scope of Care (Initial Launch)

**Included services**

* Primary care
* Mental health (therapy + psychiatric care)
* Urgent care
* Labs and basic imaging (partnered)
* Care coordination and referrals

**Excluded initially**

* Inpatient hospitalization
* Major surgery
* Oncology, NICU, trauma care

These are handled through negotiated provider relationships and reinsurance protection.

---

## Reinsurance (Catastrophic Coverage)

Keepwell does not sell insurance to members. Instead, it carries **external reinsurance** to protect the cooperative against rare, extreme costs.

### Types of coverage

**Specific stop-loss**

* Protects against high-cost individuals
* Example: Keepwell covers first $250,000 per member per year
* Reinsurer covers costs above that threshold

**Aggregate stop-loss**

* Protects against population-wide cost overruns
* Example: Expected annual spend $15M, attachment at $18M
* Reinsurer covers costs above attachment point

### Why this works

* Reinsurance engages only for rare events
* No claims handling for routine care
* No interference in clinical decision-making
* Predictable costs for employers and members

Insurance is confined to what it does best: tail risk.

---

## Why This Will Work

### 1. Employer-based enrollment solves adverse selection

Whole workforces enroll together, creating stable, predictable risk pools. This model is already accepted and understood by regulators and employers.

### 2. Most healthcare utilization is routine

Primary care, mental health, and urgent care account for the majority of interactions. Removing insurance friction here produces immediate cost and access improvements.

### 3. Clinician incentives are restored

* No prior authorizations
* No billing games
* Reasonable patient panels
* Time to practice medicine

This directly improves outcomes and retention.

### 4. Reinsurance removes existential risk

Keepwell never carries unlimited downside. Catastrophic events do not threaten solvency or force care rationing.

### 5. Surplus becomes resilience, not extraction

Any operational surplus is reinvested into:

* lower employer costs
* clinician pay and staffing
* expanded access
* improved facilities
* financial reserves

## Staffing Model (Initial Metro Launch)

**Target population:**
2,000–5,000 members

**Clinical staff (approx. for 3,000 members):**

* Primary care physicians: 3
* Mental health therapists: 6–8
* Psychiatrist: 1 (part-time acceptable)
* Nurses / medical assistants: 6–8

**Operations staff:**

* Clinic manager
* Care coordinator
* Front desk / scheduling
* IT / systems (fractional initially)

**Total staff:** ~20–25

Panel ratios are capped and monitored to prevent overload.

---

## Facilities

**Space requirements:**

* 3,500–6,000 sq ft
* Exam rooms, therapy rooms, shared spaces

**Location strategy:**

* Vacant urban storefronts or light commercial space
* High visibility, community-integrated clinics
* ADA-compliant, modular buildout

---

## Startup Costs (Estimated)

**One-time costs**

* Buildout: $750k–$1.25M
* Medical equipment: ~$300k
* IT systems (EHR, scheduling, telehealth): ~$150k
* Legal, compliance, setup: ~$150k

**One-time total:** ~$1.5–2.0M

---

## Ongoing Annual Costs (Estimated)

* Staff compensation: ~$3.0M
* Rent & utilities: ~$350k
* Labs, vendors, misc: ~$500k

**Operating total:** ~$3.8–4.0M per year

---

## Revenue Model (Illustrative)

Employer contribution example:

* $450 per member per month

3,000 members × $450 × 12 =
**~$16.2M annualized**

This supports:

* full operations
* reinsurance premiums
* reserves
* reinvestment

---

## Role of Philanthropy

Philanthropy is used as **infrastructure capital**, not operating subsidy.

Funds support:

* clinic buildout
* early operational runway
* technology
* negotiation leverage

Once launched, Keepwell is self-sustaining.

---

## What Success Looks Like

**By 6 months**

* 2,000 members enrolled
* Primary care access < 48 hours
* Mental health access < 7 days
* High clinician satisfaction

**By 12 months**

* 4,000–5,000 members
* Second clinic planned
* Reinsurance fully optimized
* Employer renewal rates > 90%

---

## Conclusion

Keepwell Health Union is not an attempt to “disrupt healthcare.”
It is an attempt to **remove unnecessary harm** from a system that has forgotten its purpose.

By restoring clear incentives, constraining insurance to its proper role, and designing governance that resists extraction, Keepwell offers a durable, humane alternative that can scale metro by metro.
