<h1 id="chapter-21-guarding-against-drift">Chapter 21: Guarding Against
Drift</h1>
<h2 id="what-happens-when-standards-slip">What happens when standards
slip</h2>
<p>Institutional drift is rarely dramatic. It happens gradually, through
small compromises that seem individually defensible but cumulatively
destructive.</p>
<p>A clinic starts scheduling 20-minute appointments instead of 30 to
improve financial performance. The change seems minor. But shorter
appointments mean less time to listen, fewer problems addressed per
visit, and more errors. Clinicians feel rushed. Members feel unheard.
Care quality declines, but slowly enough that no single moment triggers
alarm.</p>
<p>A local board appoints a new executive director who comes from the
insurance industry. The director is competent and well-meaning, but
their instincts are shaped by a different system. They introduce prior
authorization for certain services “just as a check.” They talk about
“managing utilization.” They propose incentivizing clinicians based on
productivity. Each proposal sounds reasonable in isolation. Together,
they represent a shift away from the charter.</p>
<p>A union facing financial pressure decides to delay hiring a care
navigator to cut costs. The decision is framed as temporary. But members
start getting lost in referrals. Specialists don’t communicate with
primary care. Medications get duplicated. Member satisfaction declines.
The union promises to hire the navigator “once finances improve,” but
finances don’t improve because poor care coordination drives up costs
elsewhere.</p>
<p>These are not hypothetical scenarios. They are patterns that emerge
in every institution that lacks structural mechanisms to resist
drift.</p>
<p>Keepwell guards against drift through multiple overlapping
systems:</p>
<p><strong>The charter as a binding standard.</strong> The charter is
not a guideline. It is a binding commitment that cannot be quietly
abandoned. Deviations from the charter trigger review and, if
uncorrected, revocation.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome-linked compensation.</strong> When leadership
compensation is tied to care quality, member satisfaction, and clinician
wellbeing, drift produces immediate financial consequences for those
making decisions. The system self-corrects before problems compound.</p>
<p><strong>Member and clinician representation in governance.</strong>
When the people affected by decisions have voice in governance, drift is
harder to disguise. Members notice when access declines. Clinicians
notice when panel sizes increase. Their presence on boards makes these
problems visible.</p>
<p><strong>Periodic review by the Chartering Council.</strong> External
review catches drift that internal governance might rationalize or miss.
The Council compares unions to each other and to the charter standards,
making deviations visible.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency requirements.</strong> When outcomes are
published and shared across the federation, unions cannot hide poor
performance. Declining metrics trigger scrutiny and corrective
action.</p>
<p><strong>Mother Keepwell as cultural enforcement.</strong> The
symbolic standard provides a simple test: Would Mother Keepwell approve?
This question cuts through complexity and rationalization, forcing
decision-makers to confront whether they are serving members or serving
themselves.</p>
<p>No single mechanism is sufficient. But together, they create a system
where drift is detected early, flagged publicly, and corrected
structurally.</p>
<h2 id="how-culture-is-preserved-across-locations">How culture is
preserved across locations</h2>
<p>Culture is fragile. It is built through shared experience,
transmitted through stories and rituals, and enforced through social
expectations. When organizations scale, culture often degrades because
new locations lack the context, relationships, and informal norms that
shaped the original.</p>
<p>Keepwell preserves culture across locations through deliberate
design:</p>
<p><strong>Shared language and symbols.</strong> All Keepwell unions use
the same language—members, not patients; stewardship, not management;
Mother Keepwell as the standard. This linguistic consistency creates
shared identity and reinforces values across geography.</p>
<p><strong>Standardized metrics and reporting.</strong> All unions
measure the same outcomes and report them in the same format. This
creates cultural expectations around what matters and allows mutual
accountability across the federation.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-union learning and connection.</strong> Leaders,
clinicians, and members from different unions meet regularly to share
experiences, challenges, and solutions. This builds relationships and
reinforces that Keepwell is a network, not a collection of isolated
entities.</p>
<p><strong>Chartering rituals.</strong> The process of receiving a
charter is ceremonial and significant. It involves formal adoption of
the charter, training on the principles, and public commitment to the
standards. This ritual marks entry into the federation and signals that
membership is meaningful.</p>
<p><strong>Story-sharing and documentation.</strong> The federation
documents and shares stories of how unions have handled difficult
decisions, resolved conflicts, and maintained their mission under
pressure. These stories become shared cultural knowledge that new unions
can draw on.</p>
<p><strong>Enforcement of standards.</strong> Culture is preserved not
just through positive reinforcement but through consequences for
violation. When a union drifts, it faces probation or revocation. This
sends a signal across the federation that standards are real and
violations matter.</p>
<p><strong>Mother Keepwell as persistent anchor.</strong> Every union
invokes the same symbolic standard. A new union in Texas and an
established union in Oregon both ask: Would Mother Keepwell approve?
This shared reference point creates cultural continuity even across vast
distances.</p>
<p>Culture is not fixed. It evolves. But evolution is different from
drift. Evolution is intentional adaptation to changing conditions while
preserving core values. Drift is unintentional abandonment of those
values through inattention or rationalization.</p>
<p>Keepwell’s structure allows for evolution—local unions can adapt to
their contexts—while preventing drift through binding standards, shared
symbols, and distributed enforcement.</p>
<h2 id="intervention-and-correction">Intervention and correction</h2>
<p>When drift is detected, the system intervenes. Intervention is not
punishment. It is correction.</p>
<p>The process typically follows this sequence:</p>
<p><strong>1. Detection:</strong> Drift is identified through declining
metrics, member complaints, clinician concerns, or external review by
the Chartering Council.</p>
<p><strong>2. Notification:</strong> The union is notified that it is
falling short of charter standards and given specific information about
what needs to be corrected.</p>
<p><strong>3. Support:</strong> The federation offers resources,
expertise, and peer support to help the union correct course. Other
unions that have faced similar challenges share what worked for
them.</p>
<p><strong>4. Timeline:</strong> The union is given a clear timeline for
correction, typically 6-12 months depending on the severity of the
issue.</p>
<p><strong>5. Probation:</strong> If the problem is serious or
persistent, the union is placed on probation. This is a public status
that signals to members, staff, and the federation that the union is not
in good standing.</p>
<p><strong>6. Monitoring:</strong> During probation, the union’s metrics
are reviewed more frequently and the Chartering Council provides ongoing
oversight.</p>
<p><strong>7. Revocation:</strong> If the union fails to correct the
problems within the timeline, or if it violates core principles in ways
that threaten member wellbeing, its charter is revoked.</p>
<p>Revocation is rare, but it must be possible. A system that cannot
enforce its standards eventually loses them.</p>
<p>Most interventions stop at the support stage. Unions that are
drifting usually want to correct course—they just need resources,
clarity, or outside perspective to do so. The intervention process
provides that.</p>
<p>But some unions resist correction. They rationalize the drift, blame
external factors, or refuse to acknowledge the problem. For these
unions, probation and potential revocation are necessary. The federation
cannot afford to carry unions that undermine its reputation and violate
its principles.</p>
<p>Intervention is the immune system of the federation. It detects
threats, mobilizes resources to address them, and when necessary,
removes elements that threaten the whole.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The Keepwell Principle:</strong></p>
<p><em>Institutions do not fail suddenly. They drift gradually. Guarding
against drift requires constant vigilance, clear standards, and the
willingness to intervene when those standards are violated.</em></p>
