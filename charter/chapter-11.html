<h1 id="chapter-11-bringing-care-to-work">Chapter 11: Bringing Care to
Work</h1>
<h2 id="on-site-clinics-and-regular-office-hours">On-site clinics and
regular office hours</h2>
<p>One of the largest barriers to accessing healthcare is time. Even
when care is affordable and available, finding time during work hours to
travel to a clinic, wait, see a physician, and return is a logistical
and financial burden. Employees lose productivity. Employers lose work
hours. And care is often delayed until it can no longer be deferred.</p>
<p>Keepwell Health Union addresses this by bringing care to where
members spend most of their waking hours: work.</p>
<p>For employers with sufficient membership density, Keepwell
establishes regular on-site office hours. A clinician—physician, nurse
practitioner, or mental health provider—visits the workplace on a
scheduled basis to see members. This is not emergency care. It is
routine care delivered in a way that eliminates the friction of leaving
work, commuting, and navigating an external system.</p>
<p>Members can schedule appointments during lunch breaks, before work,
or at other convenient times. They walk down the hall, see their
provider, and return to work. The entire visit might take 30 minutes
instead of three hours. This improves access, reduces absenteeism, and
allows members to address health concerns before they escalate.</p>
<p>On-site care is particularly effective for chronic condition
management, preventive visits, mental health check-ins, and minor acute
issues. A member with diabetes can have their blood sugar monitored and
medication adjusted without taking a half-day off. A member feeling
burned out can meet with a therapist without the stigma or logistical
burden of leaving the building. A member with a persistent cough can be
evaluated and treated before it becomes pneumonia.</p>
<p>This model has existed in various forms for decades—union health
clinics, company doctors, occupational health services. What makes
Keepwell different is that on-site care is integrated into the broader
membership model, not an isolated add-on. The clinician seeing members
at the workplace has access to their full medical record, coordinates
with their primary care team, and ensures continuity of care. It is not
a separate, fragmented service. It is part of a unified system.</p>
<h2 id="reducing-friction-and-lost-productivity">Reducing friction and
lost productivity</h2>
<p>The traditional model of healthcare forces employees to choose
between their health and their work. Taking time off for a medical
appointment often requires advance notice, approval, and lost wages for
hourly workers. Even for salaried employees, the disruption is
real—meetings are rescheduled, deadlines are missed, and the stress of
falling behind compounds the stress of being unwell.</p>
<p>This friction has consequences. People delay care. They ignore
symptoms until they become severe. They skip preventive visits and
chronic care appointments. The result is worse health outcomes, more
expensive interventions, and more lost productivity when small problems
become big ones.</p>
<p>Bringing care to the workplace eliminates most of this friction. When
care is convenient, people use it. When it does not require taking time
off, people access it earlier. When it is integrated into the workday,
it stops being a burden and starts being a benefit.</p>
<p>Employers benefit as well. Reduced absenteeism means fewer
disruptions to operations. Healthier employees are more productive, more
engaged, and less likely to leave for health-related reasons. And the
visibility of care—knowing that employees can address health concerns
quickly—builds trust and loyalty.</p>
<p>This is not paternalism. Keepwell does not dictate when or how
members access care. On-site services are an option, not a requirement.
Members can choose to visit the main clinic, schedule telehealth visits,
or come to the workplace if that is most convenient. The goal is to
reduce barriers, not create new obligations.</p>
<p>Reducing friction also means reducing the cognitive load of
healthcare. Navigating appointments, insurance, referrals, and billing
is exhausting even when you are healthy. When you are sick or stressed,
it becomes overwhelming. Keepwell assumes that burden. Members do not
need to figure out how to access care. They just access it.</p>
<h2 id="health-as-part-of-everyday-life">Health as part of everyday
life</h2>
<p>Healthcare should not be something you do only when you are sick. It
should be integrated into everyday life—a continuous relationship, not a
crisis response.</p>
<p>Bringing care to the workplace makes this integration possible. When
your care team is accessible during lunch, you are more likely to
mention the nagging shoulder pain you have been ignoring. When mental
health support is down the hall, you are more likely to ask for help
before burnout becomes depression. When checking in with your physician
does not require rearranging your schedule, you are more likely to
follow through on chronic care management.</p>
<p>This integration also normalizes health as a shared priority. When
colleagues see that the organization provides accessible, stigma-free
care, it sends a message: your health matters, and we have built a
system that makes caring for it easier. This is especially important for
mental health, where stigma often prevents people from seeking help.
On-site, normalized access reduces that barrier.</p>
<p>Everyday integration also allows for proactive outreach. Clinicians
who visit a workplace regularly can offer flu shots, health screenings,
and education sessions without requiring members to schedule separate
appointments. This opportunistic care catches problems early and
reinforces the message that health is an ongoing responsibility, not a
reactive scramble.</p>
<p>Keepwell is not trying to replace the clinic. The clinic remains the
hub of care, with full diagnostic capabilities, longer appointments, and
access to the complete care team. But by extending access into
workplaces, Keepwell makes care a part of everyday life rather than a
separate domain that requires navigating logistics, taking time off, and
choosing between competing priorities.</p>
<p>The result is a system that fits into members’ lives instead of
forcing members to fit into the system’s constraints. That simple
shift—from extraction to service—is the difference between healthcare
that works and healthcare that frustrates.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The Keepwell Principle:</strong></p>
<p><em>Healthcare should not require taking time off, traveling across
town, or choosing between your health and your work. Bringing care to
where people are reduces friction, improves access, and integrates
health into everyday life.</em></p>
