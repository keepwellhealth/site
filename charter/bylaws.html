<h2 id="a-chartered-member-of-the-keepwell-health-union-federation">A

<p><strong>Adopted: [Date]</strong><br />
<strong>Amended: [Date]</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="preamble">PREAMBLE</h2>
<p>These Bylaws govern [Local Name] Keepwell Health Union (the “Union”),
a nonprofit health cooperative chartered under the Mother Keepwell
Charter and operating as an independent member of the Keepwell Health
Union Federation.</p>
<p>The Union exists to steward the health of its members through direct
primary care, mental health services, and care coordination. The Union
operates under a fiduciary standard, placing the wellbeing of members
above all other interests.</p>
<p>Mother Keepwell serves as the symbolic standard by which all
decisions are judged: Would a reasonable steward, acting solely for the
long-term wellbeing of members, approve of this action?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="article-i-name-and-purpose">ARTICLE I: NAME AND PURPOSE</h2>
<h3 id="section-1.1-name">Section 1.1 Name</h3>
<p>The name of this organization shall be [Local Name] Keepwell Health
Union, a chartered member of the Keepwell Health Union Federation.</p>
<h3 id="section-1.2-purpose">Section 1.2 Purpose</h3>
<p>The Union is organized and shall operate exclusively for charitable,
educational, and healthcare purposes within the meaning of Section
501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
<p>The specific purposes are: 1. To provide comprehensive primary care,
mental health services, and care coordination to members 2. To act as a
fiduciary on behalf of members in all healthcare-related matters 3. To
maintain a sustainable, mission-aligned healthcare delivery system 4. To
participate in the Keepwell Health Union Federation through shared
learning and mutual support</p>
<h3 id="section-1.3-membership-model">Section 1.3 Membership Model</h3>
<p>The Union operates on a membership basis, not an insurance model.
Membership confers access to care, advocacy, and stewardship. The Union
does not function as a health insurance company and maintains external
reinsurance for catastrophic coverage.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="article-ii-immutable-principles">ARTICLE II: IMMUTABLE
PRINCIPLES</h2>
<p>The following principles are foundational and non-negotiable. They
cannot be amended, waived, or suspended under any circumstances:</p>
<h3 id="section-2.1-fiduciary-duty-to-members">Section 2.1 Fiduciary
Duty to Members</h3>
<p>The Union’s primary obligation is to act in the best interest of its
members. All decisions—clinical, operational, financial, and
strategic—must prioritize member wellbeing over institutional
convenience, leadership benefit, or external stakeholder interest.</p>
<h3 id="section-2.2-prohibition-on-profit-distribution">Section 2.2
Prohibition on Profit Distribution</h3>
<p>No part of the Union’s net earnings shall inure to the benefit of, or
be distributable to, any private individual, trustee, director, officer,
employee, or any other private person except: 1. Reasonable compensation
for services rendered 2. Reimbursement of expenses incurred on behalf of
the Union</p>
<p>Surplus revenues must be retained as reserves or reinvested in care
delivery, infrastructure, or member benefit.</p>

Prohibition on For-Profit Conversion</h3>
<p>The Union may not be sold, converted to for-profit status,
restructured to allow private ownership, or dissolved in a manner that
would transfer assets to private individuals or for-profit entities.
Upon dissolution, all assets shall be distributed to another chartered
Keepwell union, a nonprofit organization with similar purposes, or as
required by law.</p>
<h3 id="section-2.4-outcome-linked-leadership-compensation">Section 2.4
Outcome-Linked Leadership Compensation</h3>
<p>Leadership compensation must be substantially tied to measurable

Transparency and Accountability</h3>

result in probation or charter revocation.</p>
<h3 id="section-2.7-mother-keepwell-standard">Section 2.7 Mother
Keepwell Standard</h3>

<h2 id="appendix-a-mother-keepwell-standard">APPENDIX A: MOTHER KEEPWELL
STANDARD</h2>
<p>Mother Keepwell is the symbolic representation of the values and
judgment that Keepwell Health Union embodies. She is not a person,
founder, or authority figure. She is a decision-making heuristic.</p>
<p>Before making significant decisions, leaders ask: <strong>If Mother
Keepwell were watching, would we say we kept faith?</strong></p>
<p>This question forces clarity about whose interests are being served.
Mother Keepwell represents: - Long-term stewardship over short-term gain
- Member wellbeing over institutional convenience - Sustainability over
expansion - Care quality over cost cutting - Transparency over
complexity - Patience over urgency</p>
<p>When in doubt, choose the path that would make a reasonable steward
proud.</p>
