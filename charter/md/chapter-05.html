<h1 id="chapter-5-fiduciary-responsibility-in-healthcare">Chapter 5:
Fiduciary Responsibility in Healthcare</h1>
<h2 id="what-fiduciary-duty-means-outside-finance">What fiduciary duty
means outside finance</h2>
<p>In finance, a fiduciary is someone legally and ethically obligated to
act in the best interest of another party. A financial advisor managing
your retirement account has a fiduciary duty to recommend investments
that serve your goals, not investments that generate higher commissions
for the advisor. A trustee managing an estate has a fiduciary duty to
preserve and grow the assets for the beneficiaries, not to enrich
themselves.</p>
<p>The concept is simple: when someone else’s wellbeing depends on your
decisions, you are obligated to prioritize their interest above your
own.</p>
<p>This principle is deeply embedded in finance and law. Violating
fiduciary duty can result in lawsuits, regulatory penalties, and
professional disbarment. The standard exists because the relationship is
inherently unequal. The client depends on the fiduciary’s expertise,
judgment, and access. Without legal obligation, the temptation to
exploit that dependence is too great.</p>
<p>Healthcare has a similar—and in many ways more severe—power
imbalance. Patients depend on physicians to interpret symptoms,
recommend treatments, prescribe medications, and coordinate care.
Patients do not have the medical knowledge to evaluate whether the
advice they receive is in their best interest. They do not know if the
recommended procedure is necessary or if a cheaper alternative exists.
They do not know if the physician is referring them to a specialist
because that specialist provides the best care or because the specialist
is part of a revenue-sharing network.</p>
<p>Yet healthcare does not consistently operate under a fiduciary
standard. Physicians take an oath to “do no harm,” but that is an
ethical commitment, not a legal obligation structured into the system.
Insurers explicitly do not have fiduciary duty to patients—they have it
to shareholders. Hospitals, pharmacy benefit managers, and medical
device companies answer to revenue targets, not patient outcomes.</p>
<p>The result is a system where conflicts of interest are routine and
often invisible. The physician who owns a stake in the imaging center
where they send patients for MRIs. The insurer who denies coverage for a
necessary drug because a cheaper (but less effective) alternative
exists. The hospital that schedules elective procedures to maximize
revenue rather than clinical need.</p>
<p>None of these are necessarily illegal. But all of them violate the
spirit of fiduciary responsibility: acting in the best interest of the
person who depends on you.</p>
<p>Keepwell Health Union adopts a fiduciary posture by design. The
institution exists to serve members. Leadership compensation is tied to
member outcomes, not revenue extraction. Clinicians are shielded from
financial incentives that would conflict with patient care. Surplus is
reinvested into the system rather than distributed to private
interests.</p>
<p>This is not altruism. It is structural alignment. When the
institution’s incentives match the member’s interests, fiduciary
responsibility becomes the path of least resistance rather than a heroic
exception.</p>
<h2 id="why-advocacy-must-be-structural-not-optional">Why advocacy must
be structural, not optional</h2>
<p>In the current healthcare system, patient advocacy is a personal
virtue, not an institutional expectation. Some physicians go to
extraordinary lengths to fight insurance denials, navigate prior
authorization, and ensure their patients get the care they need. These
physicians are often celebrated as heroes.</p>
<p>But relying on individual heroism is a failure of system design. If
good care requires physicians to fight the system, then the system is
designed wrong.</p>
<p>Structural advocacy means building institutions where advocating for
the patient is the default behavior, not the exception. It means
removing the conflicts of interest that make advocacy difficult. It
means aligning incentives so that doing the right thing for the patient
is also the right thing for the institution.</p>
<p>Consider prior authorization. In the current system, insurers require
physicians to request approval before prescribing certain medications or
ordering certain procedures. The stated purpose is to prevent
unnecessary care. The actual effect is to delay care, increase
administrative burden, and deny medically necessary treatments at a high
enough rate to improve the insurer’s financial performance.</p>
<p>A physician who wants to advocate for their patient must spend hours
on the phone with the insurance company, submit additional
documentation, and sometimes appeal multiple times. This is time the
physician cannot spend seeing other patients. The system punishes
advocacy by making it expensive in time and effort.</p>
<p>In a structurally aligned system, this conflict does not exist.
Keepwell clinicians do not need prior authorization because there is no
insurance intermediary controlling treatment decisions for routine care.
The decision is made between the clinician and the member based on
clinical judgment and the member’s goals. Advocacy is not an act of
resistance—it is the normal operation of the system.</p>
<p>Structural advocacy also means care coordination is a core function,
not an afterthought. In the current system, coordinating care across
specialists, pharmacies, labs, and hospitals is left to the patient. The
patient is expected to remember which tests were ordered, follow up on
results, schedule appointments, and ensure information flows between
providers. This is a cognitive and logistical burden most patients are
not equipped to handle, especially when sick.</p>
<p>Keepwell employs care navigators whose entire job is to coordinate on
behalf of the member. This is not a concierge service for the wealthy.
It is a recognition that healthcare is complex, and expecting patients
to navigate it alone is structural neglect.</p>
<p>Advocacy must be structural because individuals burn out. Even the
most dedicated physician or nurse cannot sustain heroic effort
indefinitely. Systems that depend on individual virtue eventually fail
when those individuals leave, retire, or collapse under the weight of
impossible expectations.</p>
<p>Structural advocacy is advocacy that persists regardless of who is in
the room. It is built into job descriptions, compensation models,
workflows, and governance. It is not optional. It is how the system
operates.</p>
<h2 id="acting-in-the-members-best-interest-as-a-binding-rule">Acting in
the member’s best interest as a binding rule</h2>
<p>Keepwell Health Union enshrines fiduciary responsibility as a binding
governance principle, not an aspirational value. This means that
decisions at every level—clinical, operational, and strategic—must be
evaluated against a single standard: does this serve the member’s best
interest?</p>
<p>This is not a vague ethical guideline. It is a decision-making
framework with teeth.</p>
<p>When leadership considers expanding services, the question is not
“Will this increase revenue?” but “Will this improve member health
outcomes at a sustainable cost?” When clinicians recommend treatments,
the question is not “What is billable?” but “What is best for this
person?” When the organization evaluates partnerships, the question is
not “What is financially advantageous?” but “Does this align with our
fiduciary obligation to members?”</p>
<p>This standard is encoded in Keepwell’s charter and enforced through
governance mechanisms. Leadership compensation is tied to member
outcomes. Board members are required to prioritize fiduciary duty over
financial optimization. Conflicts of interest are disclosed and, where
possible, eliminated.</p>
<p>Fiduciary responsibility also means transparency. Members have the
right to understand how decisions are made, how their fees are spent,
and what trade-offs exist. Complexity and opacity are tools of
extraction. Clarity and transparency are tools of stewardship.</p>
<p>This does not mean every member gets everything they want. Resources
are finite, and some treatments are not clinically justified. But it
does mean that when a decision is made, the member can trust that it was
made in their interest, not in the interest of someone else’s profit
margin.</p>
<p>Acting in the member’s best interest is not a marketing slogan. It is
a binding rule. And binding rules require enforcement mechanisms,
accountability structures, and institutional design that makes violation
difficult and compliance natural.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The Keepwell Principle:</strong></p>
<p><em>Fiduciary responsibility is not a personal virtue. It is a
structural obligation. When institutions align their incentives with the
people they serve, advocacy becomes the path of least
resistance.</em></p>
