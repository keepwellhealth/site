# Chapter 3: Why Language Matters

## Why "patient" implies passivity

The word "patient" comes from the Latin *patiens*, meaning "one who suffers" or "one who endures." It is a word built on the assumption of passivity. A patient receives care. A patient waits. A patient follows instructions. A patient is acted upon.

This is not accidental. Medical language evolved in a context where physicians held nearly all knowledge and authority, and the person seeking care had little choice but to trust and comply. In that world, "patient" made sense.

But that world is gone. Modern healthcare is not about a single acute intervention by an all-knowing physician. It is about chronic condition management, preventive care, lifestyle modification, and navigating a complex system of specialists, pharmacies, and insurance requirements. None of these things work if the person receiving care is passive.

Yet we still use the word "patient," and the word shapes behavior. When someone is called a patient, they are implicitly told that their role is to wait, comply, and endure. They are discouraged from asking too many questions, challenging recommendations, or expecting transparency. The system treats them as a dependent rather than a participant.

This matters because healthcare outcomes depend on engagement. Managing diabetes requires daily decision-making. Preventing heart disease requires sustained behavior change. Accessing the right specialist requires navigating referrals, insurance networks, and appointment availability. None of this happens if the person is conditioned to passivity.

The language we use shapes the roles we accept. If we want people to be active stewards of their own health, we cannot keep calling them patients.

## Why "member" implies stewardship and continuity

Keepwell Health Union calls the people it serves "members," not patients. This is not branding. It is a structural choice that reflects a different relationship.

A member belongs to something. Membership implies continuity, not episodic interaction. You do not become a member when you are sick and stop being one when you are well. You are a member whether you visit the clinic this month or not. The relationship persists.

Membership also implies reciprocity and shared interest. Members of a cooperative have a stake in its success. They are not customers to be extracted from, and they are not liabilities to be managed. They are the reason the institution exists.

This changes behavior on both sides. When clinicians think of people as members rather than patients, the relationship becomes one of long-term stewardship. The question is not "How do I treat this acute problem?" but "How do I help this person stay healthy over years?" When people think of themselves as members rather than patients, they are more likely to engage proactively, ask questions, and expect the system to work for them.

Language is not everything. But it is not nothing. The words we use to describe relationships create the boundaries of what we think is possible. "Patient" creates a transactional, hierarchical relationship. "Member" creates a partnership.

## How institutional language shapes behavior

Institutions encode their values in language, and that language quietly shapes how people inside and outside the institution behave.

Consider the phrase "healthcare consumer." It is now common in policy discussions and industry marketing. The intent behind it was good—recognize that people have choices, empower them to shop for value, treat them as rational actors rather than passive recipients.

But "consumer" is a market term. It implies that healthcare is a product to be purchased, compared, and consumed like any other good. It assumes that people have the information, time, and leverage to make informed choices in moments of medical need. It suggests that the appropriate relationship is transactional and episodic.

This framing has real consequences. If people are consumers, then providers are vendors. If providers are vendors, then their incentive is to maximize revenue per transaction. If healthcare is a market, then the solution to every problem is more competition, more transparency, more choice. But healthcare is not a market in the way that groceries or electronics are. You cannot comparison-shop for emergency surgery. You do not have the expertise to evaluate clinical quality. And being sick removes your leverage to negotiate.

The language of "consumer" imported market logic into a domain where it does not fit, and the result has been decades of policy designed around shopping, choice, and price transparency—none of which have fundamentally improved care or controlled costs.

Similarly, consider the phrase "medical loss ratio." This is the term insurers use to describe the percentage of premium revenue spent on actual medical care. If an insurer spends 85 cents of every premium dollar on care, their medical loss ratio is 85%. 

Notice the word "loss." Spending money on care—the entire purpose of health insurance—is framed as a loss. The language reveals the incentive structure. From the insurer's perspective, paying for care is a cost to be minimized, not a service to be delivered. The term "medical loss ratio" encodes extraction directly into the vocabulary.

Language like this does not just describe reality. It shapes it. When the industry calls care spending a "loss," it trains everyone inside the system to think of care as something to be avoided rather than provided.

Keepwell Health Union is built on different language because it is built on different assumptions. We do not have customers, consumers, patients, or covered lives. We have members. We do not have a medical loss ratio. We have a care delivery rate, and the goal is to maximize it within our sustainable operating model. We do not manage risk. We steward health.

These distinctions are not semantic. They are structural. Language does not just describe the world. It builds it.

**The Keepwell Principle:**

*The words we use to describe people shape the roles they inhabit. If you call someone a patient, you teach them to be passive. If you call someone a member, you invite them to belong.*
