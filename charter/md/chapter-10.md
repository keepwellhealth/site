# Chapter 10: Direct Care and Care Coordination

## Primary care as the foundation

Primary care is the foundation of effective healthcare, yet the current system treats it as a commodity to be minimized. Physicians are pressured to see more patients in less time. Appointments are rushed. Relationships are transactional. Preventive care is deprioritized in favor of acute interventions that generate higher reimbursement.

This is backwards. Strong primary care prevents expensive downstream problems. It catches conditions early when they are easier and cheaper to treat. It provides continuity, which reduces errors and improves outcomes. It builds relationships, which improve adherence to treatment plans and patient satisfaction.

Keepwell Health Union places primary care at the center of its model. Members have direct access to their primary care team without financial friction. There are no copays to discourage visits. No deductibles to meet before care is affordable. No visit limits that force rationing. If you need to see your physician, you see your physician.

Primary care at Keepwell is also structured to allow longer appointments. The standard is 30 minutes, not 15. This gives clinicians time to listen, diagnose thoughtfully, address multiple concerns, and educate members about their health. It also reduces burnout. Physicians who have time to practice medicine well are physicians who stay in the profession.

Panel sizes are capped to ensure quality. A primary care physician at Keepwell is responsible for a smaller number of members than in traditional practices. This allows for deeper relationships, better continuity, and more responsive care. It is also more expensive in the short term, but it is cheaper in the long term because it prevents costly complications.

Primary care at Keepwell is not gatekeeping. Members do not need referrals to see specialists or obtain diagnostic tests. But the primary care team coordinates that access, ensures results are communicated back, and integrates specialist recommendations into the overall care plan. This prevents fragmentation and ensures nothing is missed.

The goal of primary care at Keepwell is not to maximize throughput. It is to keep members healthy over years. That requires time, continuity, and a system that rewards prevention rather than volume.

## Prevention, chronic care, and early intervention

Most healthcare spending is driven by conditions that are preventable or manageable with consistent care: diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, obesity, depression, and substance use disorders. These conditions do not require heroic interventions. They require sustained attention, behavior modification, regular monitoring, and access to support when things start to slip.

The current system is terrible at this. Insurance-based care is episodic. You see a doctor when something is wrong, get a prescription or referral, and then disappear until the next crisis. Chronic conditions require the opposite: continuous management, regular check-ins, and proactive adjustment before problems escalate.

Keepwell is designed for chronic care. Because members have continuous access without financial barriers, they can check in with their care team regularly. A member with diabetes does not wait until their blood sugar is dangerously high to seek care. They see their physician or nurse regularly, adjust their medication as needed, and receive support for diet and exercise changes.

Early intervention is also central to Keepwell's model. The system encourages members to seek care at the first sign of a problem, not after it has become severe. A persistent cough, unexplained fatigue, or new pain is addressed quickly, not deferred until it forces an emergency room visit.

This is only possible in a system without financial friction. If every visit costs money, people wait. If appointments are hard to get, people delay. If the relationship with the physician is transactional, people do not feel comfortable reaching out for minor concerns. Keepwell removes those barriers.

Prevention goes beyond clinical care. Care navigators help members access resources for nutrition, exercise, stress management, and social support. The system recognizes that health is determined by more than medical intervention. It is determined by daily habits, social connection, and environmental factors. Keepwell does not try to control all of those, but it does try to make the healthy choice the easier choice.

The result is a system oriented toward keeping people well rather than treating them once they are sick. This is not only more humane—it is more effective and less expensive over time.

## The role of care navigators and advocates

Care navigators are often treated as a luxury in concierge medicine. At Keepwell, they are a core structural component.

A care navigator is not a billing specialist or a scheduler. They are a member advocate whose job is to ensure that the member can access the care they need without getting lost in the system. They coordinate referrals, explain treatment options, help with appointment scheduling, follow up on test results, and troubleshoot problems.

When a member needs to see a specialist, the care navigator finds an appropriate provider, ensures the referral is sent, verifies that the appointment is scheduled, and makes sure the specialist's notes come back to the primary care team. When a member has questions about a treatment plan, the navigator explains it in plain language and connects the member with the right person to address concerns.

Care navigation is especially important for members with complex conditions who see multiple specialists. The navigator ensures that all providers are communicating, that medications are not duplicated or contraindicated, and that the member understands the overall plan. This reduces errors, improves outcomes, and gives members confidence that someone is paying attention to the whole picture.

Care navigators also handle logistical problems that would otherwise fall to the member. If a prior authorization is required for a medication (in cases where external insurance is involved), the navigator handles it. If a bill is incorrect, the navigator resolves it. If a member needs help accessing social services, the navigator connects them with resources.

This is not hand-holding. It is removing unnecessary friction from a system that has become unmanageably complex. Most people are not equipped to navigate referrals, insurance claims, billing disputes, and multi-provider coordination while also managing an illness. Expecting them to do so is structural neglect.

At Keepwell, advocacy is not optional. It is embedded in the staffing model, the budget, and the culture. Care navigators are not a premium service—they are part of what membership confers. This is what fiduciary responsibility looks like in practice.

**The Keepwell Principle:**

*Primary care is not a commodity to be minimized. It is the foundation of health. When supported properly, it prevents most of the expensive, painful problems that the current system treats reactively.*
