<h1 id="chapter-19-issuing-new-charters">Chapter 19: Issuing New
Charters</h1>
<h2 id="requirements-for-new-clinics">Requirements for new clinics</h2>
<p>The process of chartering a new Keepwell Health Union is
intentionally rigorous. This is not to restrict growth, but to ensure
that only organizations genuinely committed to the mission and capable
of delivering on it are admitted to the federation.</p>
<p>A new organization seeking a Keepwell charter must demonstrate:</p>
<p><strong>1. Alignment with core principles</strong></p>
<p>The organization must formally adopt the Mother Keepwell Charter in
its entirety. This includes fiduciary responsibility to members,
prohibition on profit distribution, outcome-linked leadership
compensation, transparency requirements, and all governance standards.
The charter is not negotiable or customizable. Adoption is
unconditional.</p>
<p><strong>2. Clinical capability</strong></p>
<p>The organization must have licensed clinicians with credentials
appropriate to the scope of care it intends to deliver. For a standard
Keepwell union offering primary care and mental health, this typically
means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary care physicians or nurse practitioners</li>
<li>Mental health therapists and psychiatric providers</li>
<li>Medical support staff (nurses, medical assistants)</li>
<li>Care coordination staff</li>
</ul>
<p>Clinicians must be willing to operate under Keepwell’s model: capped
panel sizes, longer appointment times, and compensation not tied to
visit volume.</p>
<p><strong>3. Operational infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>The organization must have or demonstrate a clear plan to secure:</p>
<ul>
<li>A physical clinic space meeting accessibility, safety, and
regulatory standards</li>
<li>Electronic health records and scheduling systems</li>
<li>Financial management and reporting systems</li>
<li>Compliance with local, state, and federal healthcare
regulations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Governance structure</strong></p>
<p>The organization must establish a local board that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clinician representation (at least 25% of board seats)</li>
<li>Member representation (at least 25% of board seats once membership
reaches sufficient size)</li>
<li>Independent community members with relevant expertise</li>
<li>Clear bylaws, conflict-of-interest policies, and decision-making
processes</li>
</ul>
<p>The board must be independent of any single employer, investor, or
external stakeholder. It must be accountable to members, not to outside
financial interests.</p>
<p><strong>5. Financial sustainability</strong></p>
<p>The organization must present a realistic financial plan showing how
it will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover startup costs (facility, equipment, initial staffing)</li>
<li>Reach operational sustainability within a reasonable timeframe
(typically 12-24 months)</li>
<li>Maintain adequate reserves as defined in the charter</li>
<li>Fund reinsurance or catastrophic coverage</li>
<li>Operate without dependence on unsustainable grants or subsidies</li>
</ul>
<p>Philanthropy may fund startup and infrastructure, but the ongoing
operational model must be self-sustaining through employer and member
fees.</p>
<p><strong>6. Member base or anchor commitments</strong></p>
<p>New unions must have either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Committed anchor employers or organizations providing a minimum
viable membership base (typically 500-1000 members), or</li>
<li>A clear pathway to reaching that threshold within 6-12 months of
launch</li>
</ul>
<p>Keepwell unions do not operate viably at very small scale. The model
requires sufficient membership to spread costs, maintain reserves, and
justify full staffing.</p>
<h2 id="adoption-of-the-charter">Adoption of the Charter</h2>
<p>Adopting the charter is not symbolic. It is a binding legal and
operational commitment. The organization must:</p>
<p><strong>Incorporate the charter into governing documents</strong>,
making it part of the organization’s bylaws, articles of incorporation,
or operating agreement. This ensures that the charter cannot be quietly
abandoned by future leadership.</p>
<p><strong>Train leadership and staff</strong> on the principles,
language, and standards of the charter. Everyone in the organization
should understand what it means to operate as a Keepwell union and how
Mother Keepwell functions as a decision-making standard.</p>
<p><strong>Implement the governance structures</strong> defined in the
charter, including outcome-linked compensation, transparency
requirements, and member representation.</p>
<p><strong>Submit to periodic review</strong> by the Chartering Council
to verify continued compliance with charter standards.</p>
<p>The charter is not flexible. Local unions have autonomy in
operations, staffing, and community partnerships. But they do not have
autonomy to reinterpret, modify, or ignore the charter. The charter is
the price of using the Keepwell name and being part of the
federation.</p>
<p>Organizations that cannot or will not adopt the charter in full
should not seek one. There is no partial membership. There is no
provisional charter. You either commit to the full model, or you operate
independently.</p>
<h2 id="local-autonomy-within-shared-constraints">Local autonomy within
shared constraints</h2>
<p>Once chartered, local unions operate with significant autonomy. They
are not franchises of a central organization. They are independent
cooperatives bound by a shared charter.</p>
<p>Local unions have authority over:</p>
<p><strong>Hiring and staffing</strong>: Unions hire their own
clinicians, administrators, and support staff based on local needs and
labor markets.</p>
<p><strong>Facility decisions</strong>: Unions choose their own clinic
locations, layouts, and buildouts based on community context and member
accessibility.</p>
<p><strong>Local partnerships</strong>: Unions negotiate with local
hospitals, specialists, labs, and pharmacies to build networks
appropriate to their geography.</p>
<p><strong>Service adaptations</strong>: Within the scope defined by the
charter, unions can add services, expand hours, or tailor offerings to
local member needs.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing and fees</strong>: Unions set membership fees based
on local costs, member demographics, and sustainable financial models.
Fees may vary between unions based on regional cost differences.</p>
<p>But local autonomy operates within shared constraints:</p>
<p><strong>Charter compliance is non-negotiable</strong>: Unions must
adhere to all governance, transparency, and care standards defined in
the charter.</p>
<p><strong>Core metrics are standardized</strong>: All unions measure
and report the same outcomes, allowing comparison and mutual learning
across the federation.</p>
<p><strong>Identity is shared</strong>: Unions use the Keepwell name and
invoke Mother Keepwell as their standard. This shared identity creates
cohesion and trust.</p>
<p><strong>Chartering review is required</strong>: Unions submit to
periodic review by the Chartering Council to verify compliance. Good
standing is conditional, not permanent.</p>
<p>This balance—local autonomy within shared constraints—allows Keepwell
to adapt to diverse communities without fragmenting into unrecognizable
variations. A Keepwell union in rural Montana will look different from
one in Brooklyn, but both are recognizably Keepwell because both operate
under the same charter and standards.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The Keepwell Principle:</strong></p>
<p><em>Replication is not expansion. Each new charter creates an
independent organization bound by the same principles. The federation
grows not by consolidation, but by replication of the model.</em></p>
