# Chapter 21: Guarding Against Drift

## What happens when standards slip

Institutional drift is rarely dramatic. It happens gradually, through small compromises that seem individually defensible but cumulatively destructive.

A clinic starts scheduling 20-minute appointments instead of 30 to improve financial performance. The change seems minor. But shorter appointments mean less time to listen, fewer problems addressed per visit, and more errors. Clinicians feel rushed. Members feel unheard. Care quality declines, but slowly enough that no single moment triggers alarm.

A local board appoints a new executive director who comes from the insurance industry. The director is competent and well-meaning, but their instincts are shaped by a different system. They introduce prior authorization for certain services "just as a check." They talk about "managing utilization." They propose incentivizing clinicians based on productivity. Each proposal sounds reasonable in isolation. Together, they represent a shift away from the charter.

A union facing financial pressure decides to delay hiring a care navigator to cut costs. The decision is framed as temporary. But members start getting lost in referrals. Specialists don't communicate with primary care. Medications get duplicated. Member satisfaction declines. The union promises to hire the navigator "once finances improve," but finances don't improve because poor care coordination drives up costs elsewhere.

These are not hypothetical scenarios. They are patterns that emerge in every institution that lacks structural mechanisms to resist drift.

Keepwell guards against drift through multiple overlapping systems:

**The charter as a binding standard.** The charter is not a guideline. It is a binding commitment that cannot be quietly abandoned. Deviations from the charter trigger review and, if uncorrected, revocation.

**Outcome-linked compensation.** When leadership compensation is tied to care quality, member satisfaction, and clinician wellbeing, drift produces immediate financial consequences for those making decisions. The system self-corrects before problems compound.

**Member and clinician representation in governance.** When the people affected by decisions have voice in governance, drift is harder to disguise. Members notice when access declines. Clinicians notice when panel sizes increase. Their presence on boards makes these problems visible.

**Periodic review by the Chartering Council.** External review catches drift that internal governance might rationalize or miss. The Council compares unions to each other and to the charter standards, making deviations visible.

**Transparency requirements.** When outcomes are published and shared across the federation, unions cannot hide poor performance. Declining metrics trigger scrutiny and corrective action.

**Mother Keepwell as cultural enforcement.** The symbolic standard provides a simple test: Would Mother Keepwell approve? This question cuts through complexity and rationalization, forcing decision-makers to confront whether they are serving members or serving themselves.

No single mechanism is sufficient. But together, they create a system where drift is detected early, flagged publicly, and corrected structurally.

## How culture is preserved across locations

Culture is fragile. It is built through shared experience, transmitted through stories and rituals, and enforced through social expectations. When organizations scale, culture often degrades because new locations lack the context, relationships, and informal norms that shaped the original.

Keepwell preserves culture across locations through deliberate design:

**Shared language and symbols.** All Keepwell unions use the same language—members, not patients; stewardship, not management; Mother Keepwell as the standard. This linguistic consistency creates shared identity and reinforces values across geography.

**Standardized metrics and reporting.** All unions measure the same outcomes and report them in the same format. This creates cultural expectations around what matters and allows mutual accountability across the federation.

**Cross-union learning and connection.** Leaders, clinicians, and members from different unions meet regularly to share experiences, challenges, and solutions. This builds relationships and reinforces that Keepwell is a network, not a collection of isolated entities.

**Chartering rituals.** The process of receiving a charter is ceremonial and significant. It involves formal adoption of the charter, training on the principles, and public commitment to the standards. This ritual marks entry into the federation and signals that membership is meaningful.

**Story-sharing and documentation.** The federation documents and shares stories of how unions have handled difficult decisions, resolved conflicts, and maintained their mission under pressure. These stories become shared cultural knowledge that new unions can draw on.

**Enforcement of standards.** Culture is preserved not just through positive reinforcement but through consequences for violation. When a union drifts, it faces probation or revocation. This sends a signal across the federation that standards are real and violations matter.

**Mother Keepwell as persistent anchor.** Every union invokes the same symbolic standard. A new union in Texas and an established union in Oregon both ask: Would Mother Keepwell approve? This shared reference point creates cultural continuity even across vast distances.

Culture is not fixed. It evolves. But evolution is different from drift. Evolution is intentional adaptation to changing conditions while preserving core values. Drift is unintentional abandonment of those values through inattention or rationalization.

Keepwell's structure allows for evolution—local unions can adapt to their contexts—while preventing drift through binding standards, shared symbols, and distributed enforcement.

## Intervention and correction

When drift is detected, the system intervenes. Intervention is not punishment. It is correction.

The process typically follows this sequence:

**1. Detection:** Drift is identified through declining metrics, member complaints, clinician concerns, or external review by the Chartering Council.

**2. Notification:** The union is notified that it is falling short of charter standards and given specific information about what needs to be corrected.

**3. Support:** The federation offers resources, expertise, and peer support to help the union correct course. Other unions that have faced similar challenges share what worked for them.

**4. Timeline:** The union is given a clear timeline for correction, typically 6-12 months depending on the severity of the issue.

**5. Probation:** If the problem is serious or persistent, the union is placed on probation. This is a public status that signals to members, staff, and the federation that the union is not in good standing.

**6. Monitoring:** During probation, the union's metrics are reviewed more frequently and the Chartering Council provides ongoing oversight.

**7. Revocation:** If the union fails to correct the problems within the timeline, or if it violates core principles in ways that threaten member wellbeing, its charter is revoked.

Revocation is rare, but it must be possible. A system that cannot enforce its standards eventually loses them.

Most interventions stop at the support stage. Unions that are drifting usually want to correct course—they just need resources, clarity, or outside perspective to do so. The intervention process provides that.

But some unions resist correction. They rationalize the drift, blame external factors, or refuse to acknowledge the problem. For these unions, probation and potential revocation are necessary. The federation cannot afford to carry unions that undermine its reputation and violate its principles.

Intervention is the immune system of the federation. It detects threats, mobilizes resources to address them, and when necessary, removes elements that threaten the whole.

**The Keepwell Principle:**

*Institutions do not fail suddenly. They drift gradually. Guarding against drift requires constant vigilance, clear standards, and the willingness to intervene when those standards are violated.*
