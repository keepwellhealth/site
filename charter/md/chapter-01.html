<h1 id="chapter-1-the-failure-of-incentives">Chapter 1: The Failure of
Incentives</h1>
<h2
id="how-modern-healthcare-optimizes-for-cost-containment-rather-than-health">How
modern healthcare optimizes for cost containment rather than health</h2>
<p>The U.S. healthcare system is not failing because of bad medicine. It
is failing because of distorted incentives.</p>
<p>Modern healthcare did not evolve to maximize health outcomes. It
evolved to manage financial risk at scale, and over time that purpose
quietly displaced the human one. What we now call “health insurance” is
largely an administrative and financial optimization layer sitting
between patients and care.</p>
<p>At its core, the system rewards insurers for controlling utilization
rather than improving health. Every denied claim, narrowed network, or
delayed authorization reduces short-term cost exposure. None of those
actions improve patient outcomes, yet they are structurally
incentivized.</p>
<p>The result is a system that treats healthcare as a cost to be
contained rather than a good to be delivered. Actuarial tables replace
clinical judgment. Billing codes become more important than diagnoses.
Administrative staff outnumber caregivers.</p>
<p>This isn’t a conspiracy, it is optimization. When the goal is to
minimize payout while maximizing premium capture, the system becomes
very good at exactly that. Unfortunately, that goal has nothing to do
with keeping people healthy.</p>
<h2 id="why-good-intentions-collapse-under-misaligned-incentives">Why
good intentions collapse under misaligned incentives</h2>
<p>Healthcare is full of well-meaning people working within a badly
designed system. Doctors want to heal. Nurses want to care.
Administrators want things to run smoothly. Patients want to get better.
Yet despite all this good intent, the system produces outcomes that
satisfy almost no one.</p>
<p>The problem is structural, not personal. When incentives are
misaligned, good intentions become friction rather than force.</p>
<p>Consider the primary care physician who knows a patient needs more
time but faces a schedule packed with 15-minute appointments. The
physician wants to provide good care. The billing structure requires
volume. The patient suffers, the physician burns out, and the system
calls this “productivity.”</p>
<p>Consider the insurance claims reviewer who denies a necessary
procedure because it falls outside protocol guidelines. The reviewer is
not evil. They are following rules designed to control costs. The rule
may be wrong. The patient may be harmed. But the reviewer’s job is not
to question the system—it is to enforce it.</p>
<p>Consider the employer who sees healthcare premiums rise 7% annually
while employee satisfaction with benefits declines. The employer wants
to provide good benefits. The insurer wants to control costs. The
employees want access to care. All three are trying to act reasonably
within a system that makes reasonable action nearly impossible.</p>
<p>Misaligned incentives do not require villains. They require only that
people optimize for what they are measured on rather than what actually
matters. When the measurements are wrong, the optimization becomes
harm.</p>
<h2 id="the-difference-between-managing-risk-and-delivering-care">The
difference between managing risk and delivering care</h2>
<p>Insurance exists to manage risk. Care exists to restore and maintain
health. These are not the same thing, and conflating them has caused
immense damage.</p>
<p>Risk management is fundamentally about prediction, pooling, and
payout minimization. It is a financial function. When it works well, it
protects people from catastrophic loss they cannot absorb individually.
House fires are insured. Car accidents are insured. Rare, expensive,
unpredictable events are what insurance is designed to handle.</p>
<p>Care delivery is fundamentally about diagnosis, treatment, and
continuity. It is a clinical function. When it works well, it keeps
people healthy, catches problems early, and intervenes before conditions
become severe. Care is about relationships, knowledge, and trust built
over time.</p>
<p>The modern U.S. healthcare system has jammed insurance into every
layer of care delivery, forcing a financial risk-management tool to
perform a clinical relationship function. The result is predictable
dysfunction.</p>
<p>When insurance controls access to primary care, patients delay visits
because they don’t want to “waste” their coverage or trigger a
deductible. When insurance dictates which medications are covered,
physicians spend hours on prior authorization paperwork instead of
patient care. When insurance determines network access, continuity of
care is sacrificed for cost optimization.</p>
<p>Risk management should protect against the unpredictable. Care
delivery should address the routine. Trying to use the same tool for
both produces a system that does neither well.</p>
<p>The failure of incentives is not abstract. It is visible in every
denied claim, every burned-out clinician, every employer struggling with
rising premiums, and every patient who delays care because navigating
the system feels impossible.</p>
<p>Fixing healthcare requires understanding that the problem is not the
people. It is the incentives. And incentives are designed, not
inevitable.</p>

<p><strong>The Keepwell Principle:</strong></p>
<p><em>A system optimized for cost containment will contain costs. A
system optimized for health will produce health. We cannot do both with
the same structure.</em></p>
