# Chapter 14: Outcome-Linked Leadership Compensation

## Why leadership pay must follow outcomes

In most organizations, leadership compensation is tied to metrics that benefit shareholders or organizational growth: revenue, profit margins, market share, stock price. These metrics encourage leaders to optimize for financial performance, often at the expense of the organization's stated mission.

In healthcare, this creates particularly perverse incentives. When hospital executives are rewarded for increasing revenue, they prioritize high-margin procedures over preventive care. When insurance executives are rewarded for reducing claims costs, they optimize for denial rates and restricted networks. When private equity-backed practice managers are rewarded for maximizing return on investment, they increase patient volume and decrease time per visit.

None of these behaviors serve patients. But they serve the people making the decisions, which is why they persist.

Keepwell Health Union inverts this structure. Leadership compensation is tied directly to member health outcomes, not financial performance. This does not mean leaders are unpaid or undercompensated. It means their financial incentives are aligned with the mission.

Specifically, a significant portion of leadership compensation—typically 20-40%—is contingent on achieving measurable outcomes in the following domains:

**Member health metrics**: Chronic disease control rates (diabetes, hypertension), preventive care completion (screenings, vaccinations), mental health access and outcomes.

**Member satisfaction**: Measured through regular surveys assessing trust, access, care quality, and overall experience.

**Care team sustainability**: Clinician retention, burnout indicators, and staff satisfaction. Healthy care teams deliver better care. If clinicians are leaving or burning out, leadership is failing.

**Financial stewardship**: Maintenance of adequate reserves, sustainable cost structures, and reinvestment into care delivery rather than extraction.

These metrics are tracked quarterly and reviewed annually. Leadership compensation adjusts based on performance. If outcomes improve, compensation increases. If outcomes decline, compensation decreases. If outcomes persistently fail to meet minimum standards, leadership is replaced.

This structure makes it impossible for leadership to succeed financially while the system fails operationally. Their interests are structurally aligned with member wellbeing, not with revenue growth or cost cutting that compromises care.

## Portfolio metrics and guardrails

Outcome-linked compensation requires careful design. The wrong metrics can be gamed. Narrow metrics can create tunnel vision. And short-term metrics can incentivize decisions that damage long-term health.

Keepwell uses a portfolio approach: multiple metrics across different domains, weighted to prevent any single metric from dominating decision-making.

**Health outcomes** (40% of variable compensation):
- Chronic condition control rates
- Preventive care completion
- Hospital admission rates (lower is better for preventable admissions)
- Emergency department utilization for non-emergent conditions

**Member experience** (30% of variable compensation):
- Access to care (appointment availability, wait times)
- Member satisfaction surveys
- Net Promoter Score (likelihood to recommend)
- Complaint and grievance resolution rates

**Care team health** (20% of variable compensation):
- Clinician retention rates
- Staff burnout assessments
- Recruitment success and time-to-fill vacancies
- Workload indicators (panel sizes, appointment lengths)

**Financial stewardship** (10% of variable compensation):
- Reserve adequacy
- Cost per member per year (contextualized by member health complexity)
- Reinvestment rate (percentage of surplus returned to care delivery)

Guardrails prevent gaming:

**No single metric can dominate.** Even if one metric is exceptionally strong, total variable compensation cannot exceed 150% of the target. This prevents hyper-focus on one domain at the expense of others.

**Poor performance in any domain limits total compensation.** If member satisfaction falls below acceptable levels, variable compensation is capped regardless of performance in other areas.

**Outcomes are risk-adjusted.** Health metrics account for member demographics and baseline health status. A union serving a sicker population is not penalized for higher costs or worse outcomes if they are achieving appropriate improvements.

**Gaming triggers investigation.** Sudden, unexplained improvements in reported metrics trigger audit. Falsifying data results in immediate termination and charter revocation.

This system is not perfect. But it is far better than the alternative, which is leaders rewarded for financial performance regardless of care quality or member outcomes.

## Avoiding metric gaming

Any metric can be gamed. Leaders under pressure will find ways to manipulate measurements if doing so benefits them personally. This is not unique to healthcare—it is a problem in every domain where performance is measured.

Keepwell addresses this through structural safeguards:

**Independent auditing.** Outcome data is reviewed by external auditors who verify that metrics are calculated correctly and represent genuine performance, not manipulation.

**Member involvement.** Members participate in satisfaction surveys and serve on governance committees. They can directly report if care quality is declining despite rosy metrics.

**Clinician input.** Staff burnout and retention metrics ensure that leadership cannot improve financial or health outcomes by overworking clinicians. If staff are leaving or burning out, leadership compensation suffers.

**Transparency.** All outcome metrics are published internally and shared across the federation. Unions with suspiciously perfect metrics relative to peers face scrutiny.

**Consequences for fraud.** Leaders caught manipulating data face immediate termination, forfeiture of variable compensation, and potential legal action. The charter of the union may also be revoked, destroying the organization's reputation and membership.

The goal is not to create a surveillance state. The goal is to make gaming difficult, detectable, and so costly that it is not worth attempting.

Outcome-linked compensation is not a silver bullet. But it changes the incentive structure in a fundamental way. Leaders who want to maximize their compensation must improve member health, member satisfaction, and care team sustainability. They cannot extract value without creating value. And that alignment is what makes the system work.

**The Keepwell Principle:**

*Leaders optimize for what they are measured on. If you measure revenue, they will maximize revenue. If you measure health, they will improve health. Choose the metrics carefully, and structure the incentives accordingly.*
