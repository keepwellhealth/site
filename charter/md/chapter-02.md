# Chapter 2: The Myth of Greed

## Why extraction emerges without villains

When healthcare systems fail, we instinctively look for someone to blame. We assume that someone must be getting rich, someone must be acting maliciously, someone must be choosing profit over people. This assumption is comforting because it suggests a clear solution: remove the bad actors, install good people, and the system will heal itself.

This is almost entirely wrong.

Extraction in healthcare does not require greed. It requires only scale, complexity, and the ordinary operation of institutional incentives. Most of the people working within extractive systems are decent, well-intentioned professionals doing what they are told the job requires. The system extracts value not because individuals are corrupt, but because the structure makes extraction the path of least resistance.

Consider the claims administrator who processes prior authorization requests. They are not rejecting claims to hurt patients. They are following protocols designed to limit the insurer's financial exposure. Those protocols were written by legal and actuarial teams optimizing for cost control. Those teams were responding to executive directives to improve margins. Those executives were responding to shareholder expectations or board mandates. At no point did anyone sit in a room and decide to harm patients. Yet harm emerges anyway.

This is how extraction works in complex systems. It is not a conspiracy. It is an emergent property. Each actor makes locally rational decisions within their incentive structure, and those decisions compound into systemic harm.

The pharmaceutical company that prices a drug at $80,000 per year is not run by monsters. It is run by people optimizing for patent lifecycle revenue, R&D cost recovery, and shareholder returns. The hospital that charges $300 for a bag of saline is not engaging in cartoonish villainy. It is offsetting negotiated rate reductions elsewhere, Medicare reimbursement gaps, and the overhead of maintaining an emergency department that treats uninsured patients.

None of these explanations make the outcomes acceptable. But they do make clear that blaming individuals misses the point. The problem is not who is in charge. The problem is what they are being asked to optimize for.

## How scale, complexity, and finance reshape institutions

When healthcare organizations were small and local, they operated with different constraints. A physician who owned their own practice had direct feedback from patients. If care was bad, people stopped coming. If prices were unreasonable, the practice failed. Accountability was immediate and personal.

As institutions scaled, that feedback loop broke. Large hospital systems, national insurers, and private equity-backed medical groups are not directly accountable to individual patients. They are accountable to boards, regulators, investors, and actuarial projections. The patient becomes a data point in a utilization model, not a person in an exam room.

Scale also introduces intermediaries. Between the patient and the physician, you now have billing departments, claims processors, prior authorization teams, pharmacy benefit managers, network administrators, and compliance officers. Each intermediary adds process, cost, and distance. Each one optimizes for their own metrics. And each one makes the system more opaque.

Complexity compounds this. Modern healthcare involves thousands of billing codes, hundreds of formulary tiers, dozens of plan designs, and intricate contractual relationships between payers, providers, and employers. No single person understands the whole system. Most people understand only their narrow slice of it. This makes systemic reform nearly impossible, because the system is too complex to redesign and too fragile to disrupt.

Finance accelerates extraction. When private equity acquires medical practices, the goal is not better care—it is return on investment within a 5-7 year time horizon. This means increasing revenue per patient, reducing staffing costs, and maximizing billable procedures. It means treating healthcare as an asset to be optimized, not a service to be delivered.

When insurers are publicly traded, their fiduciary responsibility is to shareholders, not patients. Denying claims improves margins. Narrowing networks reduces costs. Increasing premiums boosts revenue. Every quarter, executives must explain their performance to analysts who care about earnings per share, not health outcomes.

None of this requires bad people. It requires only that finance be allowed to reshape institutions that were not designed to be financial instruments.

## Why better people alone cannot fix bad systems

One of the most persistent myths in healthcare reform is that leadership change will solve the problem. Elect better politicians. Hire more compassionate CEOs. Replace the board with people who care. Install clinicians in management roles.

These changes sometimes help at the margins. But they do not fix the underlying system, because the system constrains what even well-intentioned leaders can do.

A CEO of a public health insurer cannot unilaterally decide to stop denying medically necessary claims. Doing so would reduce profitability, lower the stock price, and result in the CEO being replaced by someone willing to enforce cost controls.

A hospital administrator cannot unilaterally slash prices to what care actually costs to deliver. Doing so would make the hospital insolvent within months, forcing closure and eliminating all care capacity.

A pharmacy benefit manager executive cannot decide to pass all rebates directly to patients. Doing so would violate negotiated contracts with insurers and pharmaceutical companies, triggering legal challenges and business failure.

The problem is not that these leaders lack compassion. The problem is that the system they operate within has structural incentives that make compassion expensive and extraction profitable. Changing the people does not change the incentives. It just ensures that the next generation of leaders faces the same impossible tradeoffs.

Real reform requires changing the structure itself. It requires designing systems where the path of least resistance is aligned with patient wellbeing. It requires removing the incentive to extract, not relying on individuals to resist that incentive.

Keepwell Health Union exists because better people are not enough. We need better systems. And better systems require different ownership structures, different accountability mechanisms, and different measures of success.

**The Keepwell Principle:**

*Greed is the explanation we reach for when we do not want to face structural failure. Most harm in healthcare does not come from malice. It comes from systems that make harm profitable and care expensive.*
