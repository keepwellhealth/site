# Chapter 5: Fiduciary Responsibility in Healthcare

## What fiduciary duty means outside finance

In finance, a fiduciary is someone legally and ethically obligated to act in the best interest of another party. A financial advisor managing your retirement account has a fiduciary duty to recommend investments that serve your goals, not investments that generate higher commissions for the advisor. A trustee managing an estate has a fiduciary duty to preserve and grow the assets for the beneficiaries, not to enrich themselves.

The concept is simple: when someone else's wellbeing depends on your decisions, you are obligated to prioritize their interest above your own.

This principle is deeply embedded in finance and law. Violating fiduciary duty can result in lawsuits, regulatory penalties, and professional disbarment. The standard exists because the relationship is inherently unequal. The client depends on the fiduciary's expertise, judgment, and access. Without legal obligation, the temptation to exploit that dependence is too great.

Healthcare has a similar—and in many ways more severe—power imbalance. Patients depend on physicians to interpret symptoms, recommend treatments, prescribe medications, and coordinate care. Patients do not have the medical knowledge to evaluate whether the advice they receive is in their best interest. They do not know if the recommended procedure is necessary or if a cheaper alternative exists. They do not know if the physician is referring them to a specialist because that specialist provides the best care or because the specialist is part of a revenue-sharing network.

Yet healthcare does not consistently operate under a fiduciary standard. Physicians take an oath to "do no harm," but that is an ethical commitment, not a legal obligation structured into the system. Insurers explicitly do not have fiduciary duty to patients—they have it to shareholders. Hospitals, pharmacy benefit managers, and medical device companies answer to revenue targets, not patient outcomes.

The result is a system where conflicts of interest are routine and often invisible. The physician who owns a stake in the imaging center where they send patients for MRIs. The insurer who denies coverage for a necessary drug because a cheaper (but less effective) alternative exists. The hospital that schedules elective procedures to maximize revenue rather than clinical need.

None of these are necessarily illegal. But all of them violate the spirit of fiduciary responsibility: acting in the best interest of the person who depends on you.

Keepwell Health Union adopts a fiduciary posture by design. The institution exists to serve members. Leadership compensation is tied to member outcomes, not revenue extraction. Clinicians are shielded from financial incentives that would conflict with patient care. Surplus is reinvested into the system rather than distributed to private interests.

This is not altruism. It is structural alignment. When the institution's incentives match the member's interests, fiduciary responsibility becomes the path of least resistance rather than a heroic exception.

## Why advocacy must be structural, not optional

In the current healthcare system, patient advocacy is a personal virtue, not an institutional expectation. Some physicians go to extraordinary lengths to fight insurance denials, navigate prior authorization, and ensure their patients get the care they need. These physicians are often celebrated as heroes.

But relying on individual heroism is a failure of system design. If good care requires physicians to fight the system, then the system is designed wrong.

Structural advocacy means building institutions where advocating for the patient is the default behavior, not the exception. It means removing the conflicts of interest that make advocacy difficult. It means aligning incentives so that doing the right thing for the patient is also the right thing for the institution.

Consider prior authorization. In the current system, insurers require physicians to request approval before prescribing certain medications or ordering certain procedures. The stated purpose is to prevent unnecessary care. The actual effect is to delay care, increase administrative burden, and deny medically necessary treatments at a high enough rate to improve the insurer's financial performance.

A physician who wants to advocate for their patient must spend hours on the phone with the insurance company, submit additional documentation, and sometimes appeal multiple times. This is time the physician cannot spend seeing other patients. The system punishes advocacy by making it expensive in time and effort.

In a structurally aligned system, this conflict does not exist. Keepwell clinicians do not need prior authorization because there is no insurance intermediary controlling treatment decisions for routine care. The decision is made between the clinician and the member based on clinical judgment and the member's goals. Advocacy is not an act of resistance—it is the normal operation of the system.

Structural advocacy also means care coordination is a core function, not an afterthought. In the current system, coordinating care across specialists, pharmacies, labs, and hospitals is left to the patient. The patient is expected to remember which tests were ordered, follow up on results, schedule appointments, and ensure information flows between providers. This is a cognitive and logistical burden most patients are not equipped to handle, especially when sick.

Keepwell employs care navigators whose entire job is to coordinate on behalf of the member. This is not a concierge service for the wealthy. It is a recognition that healthcare is complex, and expecting patients to navigate it alone is structural neglect.

Advocacy must be structural because individuals burn out. Even the most dedicated physician or nurse cannot sustain heroic effort indefinitely. Systems that depend on individual virtue eventually fail when those individuals leave, retire, or collapse under the weight of impossible expectations.

Structural advocacy is advocacy that persists regardless of who is in the room. It is built into job descriptions, compensation models, workflows, and governance. It is not optional. It is how the system operates.

## Acting in the member's best interest as a binding rule

Keepwell Health Union enshrines fiduciary responsibility as a binding governance principle, not an aspirational value. This means that decisions at every level—clinical, operational, and strategic—must be evaluated against a single standard: does this serve the member's best interest?

This is not a vague ethical guideline. It is a decision-making framework with teeth.

When leadership considers expanding services, the question is not "Will this increase revenue?" but "Will this improve member health outcomes at a sustainable cost?" When clinicians recommend treatments, the question is not "What is billable?" but "What is best for this person?" When the organization evaluates partnerships, the question is not "What is financially advantageous?" but "Does this align with our fiduciary obligation to members?"

This standard is encoded in Keepwell's charter and enforced through governance mechanisms. Leadership compensation is tied to member outcomes. Board members are required to prioritize fiduciary duty over financial optimization. Conflicts of interest are disclosed and, where possible, eliminated.

Fiduciary responsibility also means transparency. Members have the right to understand how decisions are made, how their fees are spent, and what trade-offs exist. Complexity and opacity are tools of extraction. Clarity and transparency are tools of stewardship.

This does not mean every member gets everything they want. Resources are finite, and some treatments are not clinically justified. But it does mean that when a decision is made, the member can trust that it was made in their interest, not in the interest of someone else's profit margin.

Acting in the member's best interest is not a marketing slogan. It is a binding rule. And binding rules require enforcement mechanisms, accountability structures, and institutional design that makes violation difficult and compliance natural.

**The Keepwell Principle:**

*Fiduciary responsibility is not a personal virtue. It is a structural obligation. When institutions align their incentives with the people they serve, advocacy becomes the path of least resistance.*
