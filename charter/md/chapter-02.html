<h1 id="chapter-2-the-myth-of-greed">Chapter 2: The Myth of Greed</h1>
<h2 id="why-extraction-emerges-without-villains">Why extraction emerges
without villains</h2>
<p>When healthcare systems fail, we instinctively look for someone to
blame. We assume that someone must be getting rich, someone must be
acting maliciously, someone must be choosing profit over people. This
assumption is comforting because it suggests a clear solution: remove
the bad actors, install good people, and the system will heal
itself.</p>
<p>This is almost entirely wrong.</p>
<p>Extraction in healthcare does not require greed. It requires only
scale, complexity, and the ordinary operation of institutional
incentives. Most of the people working within extractive systems are
decent, well-intentioned professionals doing what they are told the job
requires. The system extracts value not because individuals are corrupt,
but because the structure makes extraction the path of least
resistance.</p>
<p>Consider the claims administrator who processes prior authorization
requests. They are not rejecting claims to hurt patients. They are
following protocols designed to limit the insurer’s financial exposure.
Those protocols were written by legal and actuarial teams optimizing for
cost control. Those teams were responding to executive directives to
improve margins. Those executives were responding to shareholder
expectations or board mandates. At no point did anyone sit in a room and
decide to harm patients. Yet harm emerges anyway.</p>
<p>This is how extraction works in complex systems. It is not a
conspiracy. It is an emergent property. Each actor makes locally
rational decisions within their incentive structure, and those decisions
compound into systemic harm.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical company that prices a drug at $80,000 per year is
not run by monsters. It is run by people optimizing for patent lifecycle
revenue, R&amp;D cost recovery, and shareholder returns. The hospital
that charges $300 for a bag of saline is not engaging in cartoonish
villainy. It is offsetting negotiated rate reductions elsewhere,
Medicare reimbursement gaps, and the overhead of maintaining an
emergency department that treats uninsured patients.</p>
<p>None of these explanations make the outcomes acceptable. But they do
make clear that blaming individuals misses the point. The problem is not
who is in charge. The problem is what they are being asked to optimize
for.</p>
<h2 id="how-scale-complexity-and-finance-reshape-institutions">How
scale, complexity, and finance reshape institutions</h2>
<p>When healthcare organizations were small and local, they operated
with different constraints. A physician who owned their own practice had
direct feedback from patients. If care was bad, people stopped coming.
If prices were unreasonable, the practice failed. Accountability was
immediate and personal.</p>
<p>As institutions scaled, that feedback loop broke. Large hospital
systems, national insurers, and private equity-backed medical groups are
not directly accountable to individual patients. They are accountable to
boards, regulators, investors, and actuarial projections. The patient
becomes a data point in a utilization model, not a person in an exam
room.</p>
<p>Scale also introduces intermediaries. Between the patient and the
physician, you now have billing departments, claims processors, prior
authorization teams, pharmacy benefit managers, network administrators,
and compliance officers. Each intermediary adds process, cost, and
distance. Each one optimizes for their own metrics. And each one makes
the system more opaque.</p>
<p>Complexity compounds this. Modern healthcare involves thousands of
billing codes, hundreds of formulary tiers, dozens of plan designs, and
intricate contractual relationships between payers, providers, and
employers. No single person understands the whole system. Most people
understand only their narrow slice of it. This makes systemic reform
nearly impossible, because the system is too complex to redesign and too
fragile to disrupt.</p>
<p>Finance accelerates extraction. When private equity acquires medical
practices, the goal is not better care—it is return on investment within
a 5-7 year time horizon. This means increasing revenue per patient,
reducing staffing costs, and maximizing billable procedures. It means
treating healthcare as an asset to be optimized, not a service to be
delivered.</p>
<p>When insurers are publicly traded, their fiduciary responsibility is
to shareholders, not patients. Denying claims improves margins.
Narrowing networks reduces costs. Increasing premiums boosts revenue.
Every quarter, executives must explain their performance to analysts who
care about earnings per share, not health outcomes.</p>
<p>None of this requires bad people. It requires only that finance be
allowed to reshape institutions that were not designed to be financial
instruments.</p>
<h2 id="why-better-people-alone-cannot-fix-bad-systems">Why better
people alone cannot fix bad systems</h2>
<p>One of the most persistent myths in healthcare reform is that
leadership change will solve the problem. Elect better politicians. Hire
more compassionate CEOs. Replace the board with people who care. Install
clinicians in management roles.</p>
<p>These changes sometimes help at the margins. But they do not fix the
underlying system, because the system constrains what even
well-intentioned leaders can do.</p>
<p>A CEO of a public health insurer cannot unilaterally decide to stop
denying medically necessary claims. Doing so would reduce profitability,
lower the stock price, and result in the CEO being replaced by someone
willing to enforce cost controls.</p>
<p>A hospital administrator cannot unilaterally slash prices to what
care actually costs to deliver. Doing so would make the hospital
insolvent within months, forcing closure and eliminating all care
capacity.</p>
<p>A pharmacy benefit manager executive cannot decide to pass all
rebates directly to patients. Doing so would violate negotiated
contracts with insurers and pharmaceutical companies, triggering legal
challenges and business failure.</p>
<p>The problem is not that these leaders lack compassion. The problem is
that the system they operate within has structural incentives that make
compassion expensive and extraction profitable. Changing the people does
not change the incentives. It just ensures that the next generation of
leaders faces the same impossible tradeoffs.</p>
<p>Real reform requires changing the structure itself. It requires
designing systems where the path of least resistance is aligned with
patient wellbeing. It requires removing the incentive to extract, not
relying on individuals to resist that incentive.</p>
<p>Keepwell Health Union exists because better people are not enough. We
need better systems. And better systems require different ownership
structures, different accountability mechanisms, and different measures
of success.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The Keepwell Principle:</strong></p>
<p><em>Greed is the explanation we reach for when we do not want to face
structural failure. Most harm in healthcare does not come from malice.
It comes from systems that make harm profitable and care
expensive.</em></p>
