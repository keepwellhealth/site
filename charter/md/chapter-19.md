# Chapter 19: Issuing New Charters

## Requirements for new clinics

The process of chartering a new Keepwell Health Union is intentionally rigorous. This is not to restrict growth, but to ensure that only organizations genuinely committed to the mission and capable of delivering on it are admitted to the federation.

A new organization seeking a Keepwell charter must demonstrate:

**1. Alignment with core principles**

The organization must formally adopt the Mother Keepwell Charter in its entirety. This includes fiduciary responsibility to members, prohibition on profit distribution, outcome-linked leadership compensation, transparency requirements, and all governance standards. The charter is not negotiable or customizable. Adoption is unconditional.

**2. Clinical capability**

The organization must have licensed clinicians with credentials appropriate to the scope of care it intends to deliver. For a standard Keepwell union offering primary care and mental health, this typically means:

- Primary care physicians or nurse practitioners
- Mental health therapists and psychiatric providers
- Medical support staff (nurses, medical assistants)
- Care coordination staff

Clinicians must be willing to operate under Keepwell's model: capped panel sizes, longer appointment times, and compensation not tied to visit volume.

**3. Operational infrastructure**

The organization must have or demonstrate a clear plan to secure:

- A physical clinic space meeting accessibility, safety, and regulatory standards
- Electronic health records and scheduling systems
- Financial management and reporting systems
- Compliance with local, state, and federal healthcare regulations

**4. Governance structure**

The organization must establish a local board that includes:

- Clinician representation (at least 25% of board seats)
- Member representation (at least 25% of board seats once membership reaches sufficient size)
- Independent community members with relevant expertise
- Clear bylaws, conflict-of-interest policies, and decision-making processes

The board must be independent of any single employer, investor, or external stakeholder. It must be accountable to members, not to outside financial interests.

**5. Financial sustainability**

The organization must present a realistic financial plan showing how it will:

- Cover startup costs (facility, equipment, initial staffing)
- Reach operational sustainability within a reasonable timeframe (typically 12-24 months)
- Maintain adequate reserves as defined in the charter
- Fund reinsurance or catastrophic coverage
- Operate without dependence on unsustainable grants or subsidies

Philanthropy may fund startup and infrastructure, but the ongoing operational model must be self-sustaining through employer and member fees.

**6. Member base or anchor commitments**

New unions must have either:

- Committed anchor employers or organizations providing a minimum viable membership base (typically 500-1000 members), or
- A clear pathway to reaching that threshold within 6-12 months of launch

Keepwell unions do not operate viably at very small scale. The model requires sufficient membership to spread costs, maintain reserves, and justify full staffing.

## Adoption of the Charter

Adopting the charter is not symbolic. It is a binding legal and operational commitment. The organization must:

**Incorporate the charter into governing documents**, making it part of the organization's bylaws, articles of incorporation, or operating agreement. This ensures that the charter cannot be quietly abandoned by future leadership.

**Train leadership and staff** on the principles, language, and standards of the charter. Everyone in the organization should understand what it means to operate as a Keepwell union and how Mother Keepwell functions as a decision-making standard.

**Implement the governance structures** defined in the charter, including outcome-linked compensation, transparency requirements, and member representation.

**Submit to periodic review** by the Chartering Council to verify continued compliance with charter standards.

The charter is not flexible. Local unions have autonomy in operations, staffing, and community partnerships. But they do not have autonomy to reinterpret, modify, or ignore the charter. The charter is the price of using the Keepwell name and being part of the federation.

Organizations that cannot or will not adopt the charter in full should not seek one. There is no partial membership. There is no provisional charter. You either commit to the full model, or you operate independently.

## Local autonomy within shared constraints

Once chartered, local unions operate with significant autonomy. They are not franchises of a central organization. They are independent cooperatives bound by a shared charter.

Local unions have authority over:

**Hiring and staffing**: Unions hire their own clinicians, administrators, and support staff based on local needs and labor markets.

**Facility decisions**: Unions choose their own clinic locations, layouts, and buildouts based on community context and member accessibility.

**Local partnerships**: Unions negotiate with local hospitals, specialists, labs, and pharmacies to build networks appropriate to their geography.

**Service adaptations**: Within the scope defined by the charter, unions can add services, expand hours, or tailor offerings to local member needs.

**Pricing and fees**: Unions set membership fees based on local costs, member demographics, and sustainable financial models. Fees may vary between unions based on regional cost differences.

But local autonomy operates within shared constraints:

**Charter compliance is non-negotiable**: Unions must adhere to all governance, transparency, and care standards defined in the charter.

**Core metrics are standardized**: All unions measure and report the same outcomes, allowing comparison and mutual learning across the federation.

**Identity is shared**: Unions use the Keepwell name and invoke Mother Keepwell as their standard. This shared identity creates cohesion and trust.

**Chartering review is required**: Unions submit to periodic review by the Chartering Council to verify compliance. Good standing is conditional, not permanent.

This balance—local autonomy within shared constraints—allows Keepwell to adapt to diverse communities without fragmenting into unrecognizable variations. A Keepwell union in rural Montana will look different from one in Brooklyn, but both are recognizably Keepwell because both operate under the same charter and standards.

**The Keepwell Principle:**

*Replication is not expansion. Each new charter creates an independent organization bound by the same principles. The federation grows not by consolidation, but by replication of the model.*
