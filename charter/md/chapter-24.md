# Chapter 24: Amendment and Evolution

## How this Charter may change

The Mother Keepwell Charter is not sacred scripture. It is a living document designed to guide a living institution. As circumstances change, as new challenges emerge, and as the federation learns from experience, the charter may need to evolve.

But evolution is not drift. Evolution is intentional, deliberate, and protective of core principles. The charter includes mechanisms for amendment precisely because it recognizes that rigidity can be as dangerous as drift.

Amendments to the charter may be proposed by:

**The Chartering Council**, based on patterns observed across the federation, emerging challenges, or recommendations from member unions.

**Individual chartered unions**, when they identify problems or opportunities that require charter-level changes.

**Coalitions of members or clinicians**, when grassroots concerns reach sufficient consensus to warrant formal consideration.

Proposals for amendment must be specific, justified, and clearly articulated. Vague or aspirational changes are not sufficient. The federation must understand exactly what is being changed, why it is being changed, and what the consequences are likely to be.

Once proposed, amendments go through a deliberative process:

**1. Public notice:** All chartered unions and their members are notified of the proposed amendment. The proposal is published and made accessible for review.

**2. Comment period:** A minimum 90-day period during which unions, members, clinicians, and other stakeholders can provide feedback, raise concerns, and suggest modifications.

**3. Deliberation:** The Chartering Council reviews the proposal, considers feedback, and may revise the amendment or reject it outright.

**4. Vote:** If the proposal advances, it is put to a vote of chartered unions. Each union gets one vote, regardless of size. A supermajority—typically two-thirds—is required for approval.

**5. Implementation:** Approved amendments are incorporated into the charter and become binding on all unions. Existing unions are given a reasonable timeline to comply. New applicants must adopt the amended charter.

This process is intentionally slow and high-threshold. Quick, easy amendments would allow the charter to be eroded through incremental changes that seem reasonable in isolation but cumulatively undermine the mission. The high bar for amendment ensures that changes are truly necessary and broadly supported.

## What cannot be changed

Not everything in the charter is subject to amendment. Some principles are foundational and non-negotiable. These are the core commitments that define what it means to be a Keepwell Health Union. They cannot be amended, negotiated, or reinterpreted.

**Non-amendable principles include:**

**Fiduciary responsibility to members as the primary obligation.** This is the foundation of the entire model. If the institution does not act in the member's best interest, it is not Keepwell.

**Prohibition on profit distribution to private individuals.** Surplus must remain in the system. This cannot be changed without transforming Keepwell into an extractive entity.

**Prohibition on for-profit conversion.** Keepwell unions cannot be sold, converted to for-profit status, or restructured in ways that allow private ownership. This protection is permanent.

**Outcome-linked leadership compensation.** Leadership must be rewarded for health outcomes, not revenue extraction. This structural alignment is non-negotiable.

**Transparency and accountability to members.** Members have the right to know how decisions are made and how resources are used. Opacity is not acceptable.

**The authority of the Chartering Council to enforce standards.** The federation must have a mechanism to intervene when unions violate the charter. Removing this authority would eliminate accountability.

**The symbolic role of Mother Keepwell.** The question "Would Mother Keepwell approve?" is central to the culture. Removing or diluting this standard would undermine the institution's moral anchor.

These principles are embedded in the charter as **immutable articles**. Any attempt to amend them is automatically rejected. They are not subject to vote, debate, or reinterpretation. They are the bedrock on which the federation is built.

This immutability serves a purpose. It ensures that future generations cannot vote away the protections that prevent mission drift and extraction. It prevents charismatic leaders from convincing the federation to abandon its principles in moments of crisis or opportunity. And it signals to members, clinicians, and the public that Keepwell's commitments are real and durable.

## Interpreting ambiguity

Even with a detailed charter, ambiguity will arise. Language is imperfect. Circumstances are complex. Good-faith actors will disagree about how principles apply to specific situations.

When ambiguity arises, the charter provides interpretive guidance:

**1. Err toward member benefit.** When a principle is unclear, the interpretation that most benefits members should prevail.

**2. Invoke Mother Keepwell.** Ask: What would a reasonable steward, acting solely for the long-term wellbeing of members, conclude? If the answer is unclear, proceed cautiously or seek external guidance.

**3. Consult federation precedent.** Other unions may have faced similar questions. Their experiences and resolutions can inform interpretation.

**4. Seek Chartering Council clarification.** When interpretation has federation-wide implications, the Council can issue formal guidance that becomes binding precedent.

**5. Document the reasoning.** When unions make interpretive decisions, they must document the reasoning and make it available for review. This creates a body of interpretive precedent and allows oversight.

Ambiguity is not license to reinterpret away inconvenient constraints. It is an opportunity to apply principles thoughtfully in new contexts. The burden is always on those proposing a new interpretation to show that it aligns with the charter's intent and serves the mission.

**The Keepwell Principle:**

*The charter evolves, but it does not drift. Core principles are immutable. Changes require deliberation, broad consensus, and high thresholds. Ambiguity is resolved in favor of members, not convenience.*
