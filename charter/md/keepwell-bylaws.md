# BYLAWS OF [LOCAL NAME] KEEPWELL HEALTH UNION

## A Chartered Member of the Keepwell Health Union Federation

**Adopted: [Date]**  
**Amended: [Date]**

---

## PREAMBLE

These Bylaws govern [Local Name] Keepwell Health Union (the "Union"), a nonprofit health cooperative chartered under the Mother Keepwell Charter and operating as an independent member of the Keepwell Health Union Federation.

The Union exists to steward the health of its members through direct primary care, mental health services, and care coordination. The Union operates under a fiduciary standard, placing the wellbeing of members above all other interests.

Mother Keepwell serves as the symbolic standard by which all decisions are judged: Would a reasonable steward, acting solely for the long-term wellbeing of members, approve of this action?

---

## ARTICLE I: NAME AND PURPOSE

### Section 1.1 Name
The name of this organization shall be [Local Name] Keepwell Health Union, a chartered member of the Keepwell Health Union Federation.

### Section 1.2 Purpose
The Union is organized and shall operate exclusively for charitable, educational, and healthcare purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code.

The specific purposes are:
1. To provide comprehensive primary care, mental health services, and care coordination to members
2. To act as a fiduciary on behalf of members in all healthcare-related matters
3. To maintain a sustainable, mission-aligned healthcare delivery system
4. To participate in the Keepwell Health Union Federation through shared learning and mutual support

### Section 1.3 Membership Model
The Union operates on a membership basis, not an insurance model. Membership confers access to care, advocacy, and stewardship. The Union does not function as a health insurance company and maintains external reinsurance for catastrophic coverage.

---

## ARTICLE II: IMMUTABLE PRINCIPLES

The following principles are foundational and non-negotiable. They cannot be amended, waived, or suspended under any circumstances:

### Section 2.1 Fiduciary Duty to Members
The Union's primary obligation is to act in the best interest of its members. All decisions—clinical, operational, financial, and strategic—must prioritize member wellbeing over institutional convenience, leadership benefit, or external stakeholder interest.

### Section 2.2 Prohibition on Profit Distribution
No part of the Union's net earnings shall inure to the benefit of, or be distributable to, any private individual, trustee, director, officer, employee, or any other private person except:
1. Reasonable compensation for services rendered
2. Reimbursement of expenses incurred on behalf of the Union

Surplus revenues must be retained as reserves or reinvested in care delivery, infrastructure, or member benefit.

### Section 2.3 Prohibition on For-Profit Conversion
The Union may not be sold, converted to for-profit status, restructured to allow private ownership, or dissolved in a manner that would transfer assets to private individuals or for-profit entities. Upon dissolution, all assets shall be distributed to another chartered Keepwell union, a nonprofit organization with similar purposes, or as required by law.

### Section 2.4 Outcome-Linked Leadership Compensation
Leadership compensation must be substantially tied to measurable member health outcomes, member satisfaction, care team sustainability, and financial stewardship. Revenue growth, profit margins, and cost containment alone may not serve as primary compensation drivers.

### Section 2.5 Transparency and Accountability
Members have the right to access information about governance decisions, financial performance, leadership compensation, and health outcomes. Opacity and secrecy are incompatible with fiduciary responsibility.

### Section 2.6 Charter Compliance
The Union operates under the Mother Keepwell Charter as issued by the Chartering Council. Charter standards are binding. Failure to comply may result in probation or charter revocation.

### Section 2.7 Mother Keepwell Standard
Mother Keepwell serves as the symbolic moral anchor for all decision-making. She is not a person, mascot, or authority figure. She represents the question: Would a reasonable steward acting solely for member wellbeing approve of this action?

## APPENDIX A: MOTHER KEEPWELL STANDARD

Mother Keepwell is the symbolic representation of the values and judgment that Keepwell Health Union embodies. She is not a person, founder, or authority figure. She is a decision-making heuristic.

Before making significant decisions, leaders ask: **If Mother Keepwell were watching, would we say we kept faith?**

This question forces clarity about whose interests are being served. Mother Keepwell represents:
- Long-term stewardship over short-term gain
- Member wellbeing over institutional convenience
- Sustainability over expansion
- Care quality over cost cutting
- Transparency over complexity
- Patience over urgency

When in doubt, choose the path that would make a reasonable steward proud.
