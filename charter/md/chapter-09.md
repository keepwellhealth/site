# Chapter 9: Membership, Not Insurance

## What membership confers

Membership in Keepwell Health Union is not a contract to purchase services. It is belonging to a system designed to steward your health over time.

When you become a member, you gain:

**Access to comprehensive primary care** without visit limits, copays, or prior authorization. This includes preventive care, acute care, chronic condition management, and routine diagnostics. The relationship with your care team is continuous, not episodic.

**Mental health services** integrated into primary care, including therapy and psychiatric care. Mental health is not treated as separate from physical health, nor is it subject to different rules or restrictions.

**Care coordination and navigation** as a core service, not an afterthought. A care navigator helps you access specialists, schedule procedures, understand treatment options, and ensure nothing falls through the cracks. You are not left to navigate the system alone.

**Transparent pricing and predictable costs.** You know what you are paying each month. There are no surprise bills, hidden fees, or complex calculations. For care outside the direct scope of Keepwell, pricing is negotiated on your behalf and explained clearly before you proceed.

**Fiduciary advocacy.** Keepwell is structurally obligated to act in your best interest. There are no financial incentives to deny care, delay treatment, or steer you toward more expensive options. The institution exists to serve you, not to extract from you.

**Long-term stewardship.** Your health is treated as a shared asset that you and your care team steward together. The system is designed for continuity, not transaction. Whether you visit the clinic this month or not, the relationship persists.

Membership also confers responsibility. Members are expected to engage with their health proactively, follow through on care plans, and participate in decisions about their treatment. The system works best when members are active partners, not passive recipients.

## What it does not replace

Keepwell Health Union is not a replacement for catastrophic insurance. It is designed to handle routine and preventive care, not rare, high-cost events like major surgery, extended hospitalization, or complex specialty treatment.

For those risks, Keepwell carries external reinsurance at the system level. Members are protected through this coverage without needing to purchase separate policies or navigate claims processes. But Keepwell is not an insurer in the traditional sense, and it does not take on unlimited financial liability.

Membership also does not replace the need for members to make healthy choices. Keepwell provides access, coordination, and support, but it cannot force behavior change. The system is designed to make healthy choices easier, but the choices are still yours.

Keepwell does not replace specialists, hospitals, or emergency services. It coordinates access to them, negotiates on your behalf, and ensures continuity across providers. But it does not own hospitals or employ every type of specialist. It works within the existing healthcare ecosystem while removing the adversarial insurance layer from routine care.

Finally, Keepwell does not replace personal responsibility for understanding your health. The system is designed to be simple and transparent, but members still need to engage, ask questions, and advocate for themselves. Clarity makes this easier, but it does not eliminate the need for active participation.

## The role of catastrophic insurance

Catastrophic insurance—or reinsurance, in Keepwell's case—exists to protect against low-probability, high-cost events that no individual or small group can afford to absorb.

Keepwell uses reinsurance in two forms:

**Specific stop-loss coverage** protects against individual high-cost cases. If a member requires treatment that exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., $250,000 in a year), the reinsurer covers costs above that level. This ensures that a single catastrophic case does not threaten the financial stability of the entire system.

**Aggregate stop-loss coverage** protects against population-wide cost overruns. If total costs for all members exceed projections by a defined margin, the reinsurer covers the excess. This smooths volatility and ensures Keepwell can continue operating even in an unusually expensive year.

Reinsurance is not invisible insurance. It is a backstop against tail risk, not a mechanism for controlling routine care. The reinsurer does not approve treatments, narrow networks, or deny claims. Reinsurance activates only after costs exceed defined thresholds, and it operates at the system level, not the individual member level.

This structure keeps insurance where it belongs: protecting against catastrophic financial risk. It removes insurance from the routine interactions between members and clinicians. The result is care that feels direct, human, and unencumbered by the administrative machinery of traditional health insurance.

Members benefit from catastrophic protection without experiencing the delays, denials, and complexity that come with traditional insurance-based care. Employers benefit from predictable costs and reduced administrative burden. Clinicians benefit from being able to practice medicine without fighting insurance bureaucracy.

This separation—routine care delivered directly, catastrophic risk covered through reinsurance—is the structural foundation of Keepwell's model. It is not a workaround or a loophole. It is a deliberate design choice that aligns incentives, reduces complexity, and returns healthcare to its proper function: keeping people well.

**The Keepwell Principle:**

*Membership is not a transaction. It is belonging to a system that treats your health as a shared, long-term responsibility. Insurance belongs at the edges, protecting against catastrophe. Care belongs at the center, delivered directly.*
