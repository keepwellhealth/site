# Chapter 1: The Failure of Incentives

## How modern healthcare optimizes for cost containment rather than health

The U.S. healthcare system is not failing because of bad medicine. It is failing because of distorted incentives.

Modern healthcare did not evolve to maximize health outcomes. It evolved to manage financial risk at scale, and over time that purpose quietly displaced the human one. What we now call "health insurance" is largely an administrative and financial optimization layer sitting between patients and care.

At its core, the system rewards insurers for controlling utilization rather than improving health. Every denied claim, narrowed network, or delayed authorization reduces short-term cost exposure. None of those actions improve patient outcomes, yet they are structurally incentivized.

The result is a system that treats healthcare as a cost to be contained rather than a good to be delivered. Actuarial tables replace clinical judgment. Billing codes become more important than diagnoses. Administrative staff outnumber caregivers.

This isn't a conspiracy, it is optimization. When the goal is to minimize payout while maximizing premium capture, the system becomes very good at exactly that. Unfortunately, that goal has nothing to do with keeping people healthy.

## Why good intentions collapse under misaligned incentives

Healthcare is full of well-meaning people working within a badly designed system. Doctors want to heal. Nurses want to care. Administrators want things to run smoothly. Patients want to get better. Yet despite all this good intent, the system produces outcomes that satisfy almost no one.

The problem is structural, not personal. When incentives are misaligned, good intentions become friction rather than force.

Consider the primary care physician who knows a patient needs more time but faces a schedule packed with 15-minute appointments. The physician wants to provide good care. The billing structure requires volume. The patient suffers, the physician burns out, and the system calls this "productivity."

Consider the insurance claims reviewer who denies a necessary procedure because it falls outside protocol guidelines. The reviewer is not evil. They are following rules designed to control costs. The rule may be wrong. The patient may be harmed. But the reviewer's job is not to question the system—it is to enforce it.

Consider the employer who sees healthcare premiums rise 7% annually while employee satisfaction with benefits declines. The employer wants to provide good benefits. The insurer wants to control costs. The employees want access to care. All three are trying to act reasonably within a system that makes reasonable action nearly impossible.

Misaligned incentives do not require villains. They require only that people optimize for what they are measured on rather than what actually matters. When the measurements are wrong, the optimization becomes harm.

## The difference between managing risk and delivering care

Insurance exists to manage risk. Care exists to restore and maintain health. These are not the same thing, and conflating them has caused immense damage.

Risk management is fundamentally about prediction, pooling, and payout minimization. It is a financial function. When it works well, it protects people from catastrophic loss they cannot absorb individually. House fires are insured. Car accidents are insured. Rare, expensive, unpredictable events are what insurance is designed to handle.

Care delivery is fundamentally about diagnosis, treatment, and continuity. It is a clinical function. When it works well, it keeps people healthy, catches problems early, and intervenes before conditions become severe. Care is about relationships, knowledge, and trust built over time.

The modern U.S. healthcare system has jammed insurance into every layer of care delivery, forcing a financial risk-management tool to perform a clinical relationship function. The result is predictable dysfunction.

When insurance controls access to primary care, patients delay visits because they don't want to "waste" their coverage or trigger a deductible. When insurance dictates which medications are covered, physicians spend hours on prior authorization paperwork instead of patient care. When insurance determines network access, continuity of care is sacrificed for cost optimization.

Risk management should protect against the unpredictable. Care delivery should address the routine. Trying to use the same tool for both produces a system that does neither well.

The failure of incentives is not abstract. It is visible in every denied claim, every burned-out clinician, every employer struggling with rising premiums, and every patient who delays care because navigating the system feels impossible.

Fixing healthcare requires understanding that the problem is not the people. It is the incentives. And incentives are designed, not inevitable.

*A system optimized for cost containment will contain costs. A system optimized for health will produce health. We cannot do both with the same structure.*
