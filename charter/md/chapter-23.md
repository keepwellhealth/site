# Chapter 23: Common Misunderstandings

## Concierge medicine

Keepwell Health Union is often compared to concierge medicine. The comparison is understandable—both models emphasize longer appointments, smaller patient panels, and direct relationships between clinicians and patients. But the similarities end there.

Concierge medicine is a premium service for wealthy individuals. Patients pay thousands of dollars annually for enhanced access, often on top of their existing insurance premiums. The model creates a two-tier system: exceptional care for those who can afford it, and the standard fragmented system for everyone else.

Keepwell is not a luxury service. It is designed to be affordable and accessible to working people through employer-based enrollment. The monthly fee is comparable to or lower than typical insurance premiums, and it covers comprehensive care without additional costs. There is no wealth barrier. There is no two-tier system.

Concierge medicine also typically does not replace insurance. Patients still need insurance for specialists, hospitalization, and procedures. The concierge physician coordinates care, but the underlying system remains insurance-based and adversarial.

Keepwell removes insurance from routine care entirely. Members do not carry separate insurance for primary care. They belong to a system that delivers care directly and uses reinsurance only for catastrophic risk. The model is structurally different, not just premium-priced.

Finally, concierge medicine is a private market solution. It does not challenge the existing system or attempt to scale beyond wealthy clientele. It is an adaptation to dysfunction, not a solution to it.

Keepwell is designed to scale responsibly and serve as an alternative system, not an escape hatch for the wealthy. It challenges the structural problems in healthcare rather than profiting from them.

## Wellness programs

Wellness programs are employer-sponsored initiatives designed to improve employee health through education, incentives, and lifestyle interventions. They often include gym memberships, health screenings, smoking cessation programs, and wellness challenges.

Keepwell is not a wellness program. Wellness programs are ancillary—they sit alongside traditional insurance without replacing it. They do not provide medical care. They do not change the underlying structure of healthcare delivery. And they are often more about reducing employer costs than improving employee health.

Keepwell provides actual medical care: primary care, mental health services, urgent care, diagnostics, and care coordination. It is not an add-on. It is the core system.

Wellness programs also suffer from limited engagement. Employees who are already healthy and health-conscious participate. Those who most need support often do not engage because the programs feel performative or punitive (e.g., higher premiums for non-participation).

Keepwell membership is universal within employer groups. It is not optional or incentive-based. Everyone receives the same access to care, and engagement happens naturally because care is accessible, affordable, and delivered without friction.

Finally, wellness programs typically focus on individual behavior change without addressing the structural barriers that make healthy choices difficult. They tell people to exercise more but do not address why a working parent with two jobs and no childcare cannot make time for the gym. They promote healthy eating but do not address food deserts or wage stagnation that makes nutritious food unaffordable.

Keepwell does not ignore individual responsibility. But it recognizes that most health outcomes are determined by access to care, social determinants, and system design—not by whether someone completed a wellness challenge.

## Cost shifting

A common criticism of alternative healthcare models is that they simply shift costs rather than reducing them. The concern is that Keepwell serves a healthier population, leaving sicker, more expensive patients in the traditional system, thereby worsening the overall problem.

This criticism would be valid if Keepwell cherry-picked members. It does not. Enrollment is employer-based and includes entire workforces, not just young, healthy employees. This creates risk pools that include people with chronic conditions, older workers, and families—not just low-utilizers.

Keepwell also reduces system-wide costs by preventing expensive downstream problems. Strong primary care, early intervention, and chronic disease management reduce emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and specialist overutilization. These savings benefit not just Keepwell members but the broader healthcare system by reducing overall demand for high-cost services.

The real cost-shifting happens in the current system. Insurers shift costs onto patients through deductibles, copays, and narrow networks. Hospitals shift costs onto insured patients to cover uncompensated care. Employers shift costs onto employees through premium increases and benefit reductions. Keepwell is designed to eliminate most of this shifting by making costs predictable and directly funding care.

Finally, Keepwell does not extract value from the system. Surplus is reinvested. There are no shareholders profiting from denial of care. The system operates at cost plus reserves. This is the opposite of cost shifting—it is cost transparency and cost discipline.

**The Keepwell Principle:**

*Keepwell is not concierge medicine for the wealthy, not a wellness program add-on, and not a cost-shifting scheme. It is a structural alternative designed to serve working people by removing unnecessary extraction and friction from healthcare delivery.*
