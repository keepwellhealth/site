# Chapter 13: The Chartering Authority

## Who may issue charters

The power to issue charters within Keepwell Health Union is not centralized in a single corporate entity. It is vested in a Chartering Council, an independent body whose sole function is to ensure that new unions meet the standards of the charter and that existing unions remain in good standing.

The Chartering Council is composed of:

- **Representatives from existing chartered unions**, ensuring that those who understand the practical realities of operating under the charter have voice in admitting new members.

- **Clinicians with experience in direct care delivery**, ensuring that clinical quality and care standards remain central to the evaluation process.

- **Members from existing unions**, ensuring that the people the system exists to serve have representation in governance decisions.

- **Independent experts in nonprofit governance, healthcare policy, and cooperative structures**, ensuring that the council benefits from external expertise and is not insular.

No single interest dominates the council. No commercial entity has representation. No investor, funder, or external stakeholder can sit on the council. This ensures that chartering decisions are made in the interest of the federation and its members, not in the interest of growth, profit, or external influence.

The Chartering Council does not own the unions. It does not extract fees beyond what is necessary to fund its operations. It does not manage, direct, or control local unions. It issues charters, monitors compliance, and intervenes only when standards are violated. Its authority is narrow and clearly defined.

This structure prevents the concentration of power that so often leads to mission drift. The council cannot become a corporate headquarters because it has no operational authority. It cannot become a profit center because it has no business model. It exists solely to protect the integrity of the charter.

## What chartering signifies

A charter is not a license. It is not permission to operate. It is a public commitment that a local union will adhere to the principles, standards, and governance structures defined in the Mother Keepwell Charter.

When a new organization seeks a charter, it must demonstrate:

**Alignment with core principles**: Fiduciary responsibility to members, prohibition on profit extraction, outcome-linked leadership compensation, and transparency.

**Operational capacity**: Adequate staffing, clinical capability, financial reserves, and administrative infrastructure to deliver care sustainably.

**Governance structure**: A local board that includes clinician and member representation, clear bylaws, and accountability mechanisms.

**Financial sustainability**: A plan for how the union will cover operating costs, maintain reserves, and ensure continuity of care without relying on unsustainable funding sources.

**Commitment to shared standards**: Agreement to measure and report the same core outcomes, participate in mutual learning, and submit to periodic review.

The chartering process is rigorous. It is not designed to make admission easy. It is designed to ensure that only organizations genuinely committed to the mission and capable of executing it are admitted to the federation. A weak or poorly governed union does not just fail itself—it damages the reputation and credibility of the entire network.

Once chartered, a union is recognized as part of the Keepwell Health Union federation. It can use the Keepwell name, invoke Mother Keepwell as its symbolic standard, and participate in shared learning and mutual support. But that recognition comes with ongoing obligations.

## Good standing, probation, and revocation

A charter is not permanent. It is conditional on continued adherence to the standards of the federation.

**Good standing** means that a union is meeting its obligations: delivering quality care, maintaining transparency, adhering to governance principles, and reporting outcomes. Unions in good standing participate fully in the federation, benefit from shared learning, and are recognized as part of the network.

**Probation** occurs when a union falls short of standards but the violations are not severe enough to warrant immediate revocation. Probation is a signal that the union must correct course. Common reasons for probation include:

- Declining care quality metrics that are not being addressed
- Financial instability that threatens continuity of care
- Governance failures such as conflicts of interest or lack of transparency
- Violations of member trust or fiduciary duty

A union on probation receives support from the Chartering Council and other unions to address the issues. But probation is also a warning. If the problems are not corrected within a defined period, the charter will be revoked.

**Revocation** is the termination of a union's charter. It is the most severe action the Chartering Council can take, and it is reserved for unions that violate core principles or fail to correct serious problems after probation.

Revocation does not destroy the organization. The local union can continue to operate as an independent entity. But it can no longer call itself a Keepwell Health Union, invoke Mother Keepwell, or claim association with the federation. This loss of identity and reputation is significant, and it protects the broader network from being tainted by an organization that has abandoned the mission.

Revocation also serves as a deterrent. It makes clear that charter membership is not an entitlement. It is a responsibility, and failure to uphold that responsibility has consequences.

This governance structure—limited authority, clear standards, meaningful enforcement—is designed to preserve the integrity of the federation without creating bureaucracy or centralized control. The Chartering Council is powerful enough to protect the mission but constrained enough that it cannot become the mission.

**The Keepwell Principle:**

*A charter is a commitment, not a license. It signifies adherence to standards that persist beyond individual leaders. When standards are violated, the charter can be revoked. This is not punishment. It is protection.*
